```bash
yarn start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

#### Yarn development scripts

- `yarn dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `yarn build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `yarn start` — Starts the application in production mode.
- `yarn type-check` — Validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `yarn lint` — Runs ESLint for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn format` — Runs Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn commit` — Run commitizen. Alternative to `git commit`.
- `yarn storybook` - Run storybook locally at `http://localhost:6006`.

#### Directory structure

- [`.github`](.github) — GitHub configuration including the CI workflow.<br>
- [`.husky`](.husky) — Husky configuration and hooks.<br>
- [`public`](./public) — Static assets such as robots.txt, images, and favicon.<br>
- [`src`](./src) — Application source code, including pages, components, styles.

#### Commit messages

##### Committing using Git CLI:

Using `git commit` or `git cz` will automatically bring up a prompt that guide you through the repo commit conventions.

##### If you are commiting through a Git GUI please follow these specifications below:

Commit messages must conform to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

`<type>` must be one of the following:

| type     | description                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)         |
| chore    | Changes that do not affect production; e.x., updating grunt tasks, etc.                                     |
| ci       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |
| docs     | Documentation only changes                                                                                  |
| feat     | A new feature                                                                                               |
| fix      | A bug fix                                                                                                   |
| perf     | A code change that improves performance                                                                     |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                                   |
| revert   | A commit that reverts a previous commit                                                                     |
| style    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)      |
| test     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                           |
