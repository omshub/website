I got the equivalent of an A but the workload was especially intense the first 4-5 weeks as I had to cope with both the material and learning to use R.

It got very intense for me the last 4-5 weeks through the final trying to follow math (mostly linear algebra) I should have known once upon a time but probably didn't learn properly and would have now forgotten at any rate. Completing it and mostly following the math was very satisfying.\nThat said, the homework was reasonably easy to do without following the math, it was laid out step by step with the final destination not necessarily well in focus; I would actually have liked a bit less hand holding along the way (it was pretty much routine to get 100 on homework). \n24 hour exam format was a winner, it gave those of us who don't code for a living a chance to demonstrate what we had learned. The final question on the final exam was great; I wish there'd been a couple more like that along the way.",

Also, the descriptions and pre-reqs say nothing about the higher level math you need. I swear there were symbols I've never seen. I did 2 semesters of Calculus over 25 years ago (as well as a semester of linear algebra).\nThe homeworks and projects were generally OK. Homework 3 required you to code logistic regression by hand, when there are perfectly good functions built in, so that was pretty absurd. Especially since the lectures were very high level. It was basically the old game where they teach you how to draw an owl by drawing 2 ovals and then in the next frame show you a finished detailed owl. Good luck with that one.\nThis was my first class. If my next semester is the same experience, I will be dropping out. I learned very little (I actually have taken some ML courses before) and found it highly frustrating.",

    body: "I really enjoyed this class. At first it didn't seem clear what level of linear algebra we'd need to be successful in the course—as someone who hadn't studied matrix manipulation in about 20 years, I was apprehensive. But the ramp-up was gradual, and they did a good job of explaining sophisticated concepts while providing surface-level challenges.\n\nI started the class having just taken CS1301x, also available on edX. I highly recommend students take this course (or similar) before embarking on CSE6040. I also took the GA Tech linear algebra primer on Udacity. I feel like I would have been playing an exhausting game of catch-up if I hadn't. If you don't have Python experience, get some before enrolling.\n\nI found the challenge balance very satisfying. It definitely broadened and stretched my understanding of the math side of data manipulation. There were times when I thought I was finally in hopelessly over my head, but a bit of research or just plain staring at the code eventually led to (very satisfying) breakthroughs.\n\nI appreciate how responsive the instructor was to changing the test format from two proctored hours to 24 unproctored. It much better measured our ability and concept absorption—and was also confiding to know the staff were listening to our concerns in real time. That's a big deal in an online course.",

The instructors and TAs really deserve recognition for this. Maybe it's because the course material is just so darn interesting, but WOW, I've never felt this inspired to learn. The assignments are thought provoking, and the project is an absolute blast. \n\nI disagree with what others have to say about needing to be a \"python expert\". I program in. NET at my day job, and found the jump to be fairly easy. It absolutely helps if you're a strong programmer, however. If you're not, what are you doing in a masters computer science course anyways?\n\nA minor critique about the class - maybe less writing assignments, and more programming assignments. Often throughout the class I wished I was given time to implement some of the ideas you write about. Also, the project is amazing, but I think they need to reexamine their policy on what external libraries you can use.

    body: "Unfortunately, this class is pretty much a failure. \n\nOne major problem (and certainly not the least of the problems) is that the course staff is completely disorganized. Nearly every single assignment due date has been revised once or twice. The staff acts as if this is a favor to the students to keep pushing out the dates, but it makes it extremely hard to know what's going on with the course. On top of that, they promise that assignments and documents will be released by certain dates and VERY consistently actually release them several days later (and often push the due dates out in response). \n\nThe lectures are fine. They do a pretty good job of covering the current healthcare situation in the US and different IT solutions/problems to these. Every 2-3 weeks another little quiz is due that tests whether or not you've watched the lectures - I can mostly ignore these until they're due, watch the group of lectures on fast forward in less than an hour, and then take the (open book/notes) quiz using the lecture transcripts for reference. The amount of useful knowledge I feel like I gain from the lectures is minimal. \n\nThe project is ill-defined and we have been able to receive little useful feedback from the assigned TA. It doesn't help anything that the grades and feedback for each assigned deliverable is extremely late (you get feedback from the last assignment nearly by the time the next one is due) and not-at-all detailed. It's hard to know if the project is going in a reasonable direction for a solid grade. *shrug* I guess we'll see. \n\nThere was supposed to be some interesting programming exercises for working with FHIR. This was updated to be some quizzes instead. Apparently, they thought the Masters Computer Science students were too incompetent to figure out some programming exercises. \n\nGaTech really needs to reevaluate this one... Take this one if it's required or if you need easy credits. Don't expect that you'll get much out of it though.",

    body: "TL;DR: You must be a very good with Python before taking. Assignments are vague and seem hastily prepared. Instructors and TAs good. Most problems probably due to first time offering\n\nIt's best to think of these class as seminar where the lectures are really only a cursory review of the material but you are then expected to do independent research to implement the assignments. (One assignment involving MCMC is covered in the lecture for only 90 seconds). Unlike many classes where the starter code provides a lot of the minutia functionality, this class you pretty much build from the ground up. The starter code when provided is sparsely documented and seems hastily prepared. Got the impression that each TA was assigned the task of creating one homework for the class, but then those assignments weren't tested or validated by the other TAs/Instructor prior to launch. In many of the other classes, (like Intro to CV or KBAI) the assignments, while hard, show polish from having been refined over the years rather than being rushed to meet production deadline. \n\nThe biggest problem though is that after an assignment, there's no follow up by staff as to what the right approach or solution might have been. Didn't get it solved? Too bad. Students aren't allowed to share solutions or general approaches after the fact either. Makes it hard to learn if you struggle with an assignment but then get no feedback other than a grade. There was discussion of this being due to Piazza. Hopefully on future iterations the TAs/Staff will figure out how to lock it down so that they don't have to worry about future students finding the previous class forums. \n\nApparently the curve is generous, so supposedly everybody will be getting Bs or As. I was getting a high A when I dropped. I dropped because of the lack of feedback. \n\nI'm optimistic that future iterations will work a lot of the 'first-time-offered' bugs out.",

The class covers a wide swathe of the machine learning spectrum. The lectures themselves don't get too deep, but they do a good job of familiarizing you with a lot of concepts. \n\nThere is quite a bit of supplemental reading, both with the primary text and several other papers. Not so much as AOS had, but still a fair amount. \n\nProfessor Isbell and the TAs are pretty responsive on Piazza. Elijah has been very active and helpful in particular. \n\nThe bulk of the difficulty comes with the projects. They are very open ended: you can use whatever data sets or framework you want to complete them. All of the coding and experimentation is just a set up for the analysis you write, which is the real centerpiece of a project. Writing a good analysis requires really understanding what is going on and will require a fair amount of independent research, above and beyond what the lectures and supplemental reading provide. It's tough, but I find that it gives a thorough understanding of the area. For me each of the projects has taken around 50-60 hours to complete. They come at a two to three week cadence. Budget your time appropriately. \n\nFor some of the projects it is likely that you will end up using ABAGAIL, which is maintained by Pushkar. It's pretty solid, although it has some blemishes. My only complaint with it is that there are standing bugs in it which are fixed by several-month-old pull requests. You can go and find these yourself, but they really should be merged. \n\nI've only had the midterm so far, and I must admit it is probably one of the hardest I've ever had. It is intentionally hard. My understanding is not that it is meant to weed people out, but to separate the truly outstanding students. \n\nOverall, if you like machine learning and you're willing to take on a tough course, I highly recommend this one.",

So much writing with this class that I made up for the lack of it in ML by dropping the course and writing a 50k word book. \n\nIn all seriousness though, this course was exemplary for interaction for student-student and student-teaching staff. I liked the peer review, even when it was a slog, because it helped me to see the range of students in the course and not just from the snippets of conversation on Piazza. Also requiring this interaction felt like we were doing something, rather than just posting problems to Piazza.',

    body: "TL;DR: This is a fascinating class, but seriously consider taking it by itself. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n-Fascinating topics (OpenMP, MPI, caching)\n-Dr. Vuduc keeps the lectures lighthearted and interesting. \n-You get 2 \"48 hour\" late passes to turn projects in late with full credit. \n-You get a \"48 hour make your performance better\" period if you don't like where your grade is after they're released. This only applies if you actually turned something in though. They take the top result, so you don't need to worry about your grade going down. \n-The Piazza forum is active (with both the TAs and Dr. Vuduc replying). \n-Grading is fair. \n\nTHE BAD:\n-The projects take a SIGNIFICANT amount of time. Even with a very good knowledge of C/C++ I found that I was still spending 30-40+ hours on each project (except for lab0). Heed what others are saying. Do *not* wait till the weekend they're due. \n-The Udacity \"autograder\" can be a complete pain in the behind. At times the output isn't very helpful on why it failed. On top of that, the TAs generally don't expound upon what the grader is actually testing. Depending on the project, you can spend a significant amount of time just passing the autograder. \n-The projects have *roughly* a two week cadence. So you're always going to be working on something for this class (circle back to comment in the TL;DR). \n-Office hours aren't consistent. We'll have one every week and then nothing for 2-3 weeks. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe class averaged 23. 8/50 on the midterm and it was curved to being out of 40. While they didn't have to curve at all; this meant the majority of the class got a D or lower on the exam. Some of us were disappointed that last semester the average was 19/50 and it was curved to out of 30. To be fair though, two people got above 40 which is what likely \"broke\" the curve. \n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS:\n-Have a good working knowledge of C/C++. Especially pointers. \n-Go to (or watch) the office hours. \n-Give the class the time it needs.",

Granted, I took it the first semester it was offered in OMS so I was expecting some issues with course content, coordination, and communication. However, it was much worse than I expected and I decided to drop the class and possibly come back to it in a future semester if I get the sense things have improved. This could be a really good class but, as it was, I spent 95% of my time hacking and 5% learning which is not a good educational return on my time. Some things to know or review prior to this class: SQL (particularly joins), how to derive equations , Vagrant VM. Also, be aware that you will be using newer data tools and technologies which could be very valuable to learn but good documentation seemed to be very lacking and the labs barely scratched the surface of what you will need to know to get through the homework. I would strongly recommend taking this class on its own.",

This was the first sem of the class, so there are some bugs to work out, interesting wording, etc. The office hours haven't been great, but that is my only complaint so far. You do not need to be running native linux as the course description might suggest. I didn't need my Ubuntu VM (same one I used for IOS) until the 5th assignment and some students got it working in Windows I think. The lectures are well done and interesting.

There is wide variation in the grading and a simple mistake followed by a completely correct proof can land you with a huge penalty.

Thrun, is considered one of the pioneers in his field and has a unique teaching style. Also, the TAs were really helpful and know their stuff. \n\nThe class is divided into two parts (lectures with homework) and (two projects). The first part of the course is pretty straight forward. The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that. \n\nTo prepare, I advise:\n1. having a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher). \n2. Artificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful)",

    body: "This course is both very challenging and interesting. The word \"introductory\" in the title can be quite misleading. When I took this course, I presumed that the course teaches OpenMP and MPI. It doesn't. You are required to study these as part of the course and use them in solving the assignments. The course focuses more on algorithms and divided into 3 parts:\n\n1. Shared memory parallelism (OpenMP)\n2. Distributed memory parallelism (MPI)\n3. Cache based optimizations\n\nLectures: The course content is very good, but may require multiple readings/viewings before it can be assimilated. This was my 5th course, and my toughest so far. The instructor is hilarious. His jokes are very creative and funny and perhaps compensate for the heavy lecture material. \n\nAssignments: There are a total of 5 assignments. Of these 3 are reasonable. 2 are very tough (There are students who spent more than 40-50 hrs on an assignment and still couldn't complete it). If you get an assignment to work you get about 80-90% credit. The remaining 10-20% goes for performance improvements. The problem is that if you don't get the assignment to work, you lose big time. And that can be harsh, because many students spend most of their time just getting it to work. Do not underestimate the assignments and start early. Also, you need to be comfortable with C, C++ (especially pointer handling). Without this you will struggle in implementing some assignments. \n\nMidterms/Final exam: These can be quite tough. The midterm had a class average of around 19/50. The final exam had a class average of about 29/50. You have to be really well versed in the course content to do well in the exams. \n\nGrading: I do not know the exact grade distribution but based on the numbers shown on this website, the percentage of A's seem to be the lowest among current courses while the number of C's seemed to be the highest compared to current courses. Not the course to take if you want to get away with an easy grade. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in knowing more about HPC algorithms and are willing to work hard.",

    body: "I really enjoyed this class. It helped me develop a good understanding of networking and I thought Prof Lillethun and the TAs did a really good job. I got a pretty high mark in this class (97), so I thought I would share a couple of tips that might help others that are planning to take it:\n\n1. As mentioned in the other reviews, some of the questions on the quizzes can be vague and easily misinterpreted. My approach on the quizzes was to make sure I researched each question throughly, considered all possible interpretations, and if necessary, post a private message to the Instructors requesting clarification. I tried to ensure my questions were concise, clear (sighting examples where possible), and demonstrated that I understood the related material throughly. In my experience, Prof Lillethun and the TAs were forthright and always willing to clarify things. \n\n2. Use office hours effectively! Office hours are your opportunity to speak to the Prof about the material and get answers and direction on homework, quizzes, and projects. The Instructors were willing to put a lot of time into the office hours, so take advantage of it. \n \n3. In advance of the quiz, they provide homework questions and answers. The homework answers are very useful on the quizzes. Use them. \n\n4. T-square sucks. When you answer a question that accepts multiple answers, do not guess at an answer. Incorrect choices will be deducted from any correct choices. So be conservative. Don't gamble on choices that you aren't sure of. \n \n5. T-square sucks. Make sure you record your answers and back them up on your computer. \n\n6. The projects aren't very hard, but you do need to have *some basic* programming. experience. If this isn't you, you might as well use this course to begin developing that experience (because Python is a good first language to learn, and you will certainly need it on other courses in the program). Prepare for the class by learning how to use basic data structures (maps, lists, sets), write methods, and declare variables. This is basic stuff, but a number of people seemed unprepared.",

I thought about quitting half-way through the class and received a C on the first homework BUT ended up with an A in the final course. \n\nThere are opportunities for "extra credit", where you can show that you have done extra work and get potential lift points if you\'re in between grades - it is not clear how this is done but it worked to my benefit. The class is very open about sharing algorithms (but not write ups) and discussion boards are full of people exchanging ideas and helping students that are stuck. Very collaborative class and it promotes open sources and sharing in the CS community. Also, I appreciated peer feedback because then I could see how other approached the same question & with different languages. \n\nThis class took over my life for a few months but I am a stronger technical person as a result.

Bomb a test, and it could drop you a letter grade. \n- Projects: Not much assistance was offered, and if you got stuck on a coding issue, not much help was available (except from Piazza, see above)\nTIPS for the CLASS:\nIf you are thinking about taking this class, here are some useful tips:\n- PYTHON - make sure you have good Python programming skills. If not, you will struggle with the projects. The class assumes you can write Python programs. \n- If you didn't take an undergraduate Networking class, consider getting the suggested textbook: Computer Networking - A Top Down Approach. This was helpful\n- Attend (or watch afterwards) all the Office Hours - very helpful and critical to my passing the class (professor gives good hints on the tough test questions)\n- Read all the posts on Piazza. Again this provided hints and details on tough test questions. \n- And don't forget to have fun!",

By the end of it, you learn an amazing amount of material. I seem to be in a minority, but I felt the embedded quizzes were great (despite typos & errors) and really helped to reinforce the course material. You can always hit the skip to answer button if you run into trouble. You got credit for just attempting the quizzes. \n\nThere is a partner option for the last two projects which was great. That became an important channel of communication for working out issues that were not addressed via Piazza. \n\nGenerally positive -- I quite enjoyed the project and felt like the effort level involved was quite reasonable (8-15 hours). If you cannot read C++ or figure out undocumented code you will have trouble. This is a real academic simulator, written by people just trying to get things done; commenting was a secondary concern. The actual coding you do is 20-50 lines, the trouble is just figuring out where they go. Having read horror stories about multi-hour simulations from prior terms, I was pleasantly surprised that the simulations took only a couple of minutes. \n\nThe Major issue (as stated by others) -- was the Piazza interaction with the professor & TAs. Office hours were cancelled for a few weeks, then disappeared altogether. Logistics around projects and exams were poorly communicated. Halfway through the semester instructor (professor / and especially TA) participation fell off a cliff. Shockingly, there was no formal announcement for the Final Exam!\n\nOverall -- the content is great, but be prepared to have to figure things out on your own. Make sure you take the lab partner option as he/she will be one of the best resources to resolve issues that you are unable to post publicly to Piazza.',

After reviewing sample projects in the wiki, I felt our batch got quite easy projects :)\n- All in all, it is a wonderful course, even if you are not specializing in computing systems, it is always useful to understand how processors are designed",

    body: "Projects were a major pain, people did awful on the midterm and final, but somehow the polling shows a ton of people got As in the class. This should tell anyone that this class is broken. \n\nIf you start this class, don't drop it, because chances are you will get scaled to an A or a B. Here is a link to a grade distribution chart that showing there are very few Cs, Ds, and Fs given. http://critique. gatech. edu/prof. php?id=RAMACHANDRANUMAKISHORE#CS6210 \n\nThis was my first class and I would consider it garbage. Yes, I learned a good bit and the concepts in the projects were good. Our class avg on the midterm was a 56. 5 and the median was 57. 75. The grades on the final were mostly C's. Even with such awful grades, I would say they were very gracious in the grading. I got a 77 on the midterm and a 73 on the final, and if they had graded them correctly I would have done much worse. I flat out didn't read the papers, and only studied the videos and my notes on them. I also didn't do the paper summaries and I somehow only got 30% on the message board participation. Actually there were people who posted hundreds of times and were very helpful that only got 2/3 of the participation points. Anyways, I got an 83 unscaled and somehow got an A in the class. Anytime a teach has to scale this much and has such poor test grades, the teacher is doing a poor job. From what I've read, I don't expect other classes to be such a mess though.",

    body: 'I enjoyed the course a lot, though there can be times when it is exhausting from all the time spent on the projects or going from projects to exams and back. However in the end I felt it was worthwhile and the projects gave a lot more hands-on practice with some of the methods we studied in the class. \n\nThe first half of the class can be a bit daunting in terms of the amount of material for the midterm - Supervised Learning covers a lot of lectures and most of the textbook for the class. The latter half of the class is a bit less material with respect to studying for the final. In that respect you should try to stay on or ahead of the schedule and readings so you don\'t feel overwhelmed getting prepared for the midterm. \n\nIn terms of the projects, the first one can feel daunting as you must select two datasets to use for this project (and reuse them for parts of later projects) and then apply a bunch of supervised learning methods to the data sets and then compare and contrast. Without giving things away, I would say on that first project try to focus on getting some plots that will help you to compare the algorithms in terms of different parameters, error rates and runtimes. Having the plots is really crucial to doing well on the assignments. As I moved on through the course I also found it helpful to write the report as I went along instead of running a ton of experiments and then trying to write it up at the end - since only the report matters for the project grades the most important thing is to start putting words (and plots) to paper, and that can help with "analysis paralysis". \n\nUse the software you are comfortable with for the class. Whether you prefer Python, R, or Java stick with what you like and you will probably be happier. But also the randomized optimization project has a MIMIC implementation in the ABAGAIL package (Java) and the reinforcement learning project works well with BURLAP (Java), and using those may make things easier for those projects. \n\nIf you do use java and want to get a head start on the class one activity that would be useful it watching the Weka tutorial, which walks through how to load data in Weka and use the different classifiers and classifier parameters in Weka. Learning to use either the Weka CLI or APIs to programmatically run classifiers is also helpful as you can use that to run a series of experiments to see how tuning parameters in the learning algorithms impacts the results. \n\nFinally believe Charles when he says not to panic on the midterm results. The mean on our midterm was around 50/100 but that corresponded to the equivalent of an A, and the B range was 20-30 points and up. So even if you feel bad about the midterm don\'t give up, submit all the projects and you should end up okay.',

    body: 'Unlike some, I do not have a very favorable opinion of this class. I did learn quite a bit. But the bottom-line; the amount of time used was excessive compared to the value of the knowledge gained. So, a highly inefficient learning experience overall. I have a strong CS background. As an undergraduate, I received a 3. 97 GPA for my computer science work and have received an A in every other class in the OMSCS program that I have taken for a grade except for this one. In this class, I received a B. In fact, only 16% of the students in this class received an A, and as can be seen by looking at Course Critique (https://critique. gatech. edu/course. php?id=CS6505), the grade distribution with the current instructor is skewed in a direction generally unfavorable to students. So beware, if you choose to take this course, you are in for a huge amount of work and perhaps a significant amount of stress. In my opinion, it would be perfectly reasonable to choose your specialization such that you could avoid this class. Alas, at the moment that would mean that you specialize in Interactive Intelligence, although there might be other ways to dodge this class while specializing in Robotics or Machine Learning in the future if they expand their algorithms offerings. Anyway, in my opinion, this class isn\'t going to give you any deep insights about the world; but it will seriously mess up your schedule for the semester. It is a perfectly reasonable choice to choose your specialization specifically so you can avoid this class. \n\nThe current instructor, Chris Pryby, has a Ph. D. in mathematics, not in computer science. Not surprisingly, this class has a certain bias towards mathematics. I would say that the way that the class was administered in Fall of 2015 that it is about 80% math and only 20% computer science. Of course, if the instructor were to change, it is perfectly possible for this bias to change as well. To make the point: if you were to choose your undergraduate major based on your desire to complete this class, I would recommend that you major in math rather than computer science. Alas, since most of you have probably finished undergrad, this is a useless point as a practical matter but very important in terms of how you should prepare yourself for success in this class. What is important in this class is not so much your ability to implement any algorithm or concept, but instead to produce mathematical proofs that relate to them. \n\nAs a side note. The mathematics in this class is not particularly hard. I had a colleague at work who was a mathematics major before receiving his Ph. D. in bioinformatics assert that the level of mathematics in this course appeared to be at about an undergraduate level when he saw what I was doing as far as the homework. It is not the formal level of mathematics in this class that makes the course hard, it is the way that this mathematics is taught (or more accurately, really not taught in the class) that makes the course hard. Basically, for this class, you either know the mathematics (including proof techniques) already or you are going to have to teach yourself. I would personally put this up as one of my pet peeves about the course. (And full disclosure, I have several such pet peeves). The lectures are sort of computer science oriented and sometimes even interesting when Lance Fortnow was in the picture. But the homework is really all math. And the math in the homework is not anything that is covered in the lectures. So, if you are someone who likes to learn from lecture like I do, you will be at a disadvantage, because you are going to have to teach yourself any undergraduate-level math concepts you are missing from the Internet or from a textbook or whatever on your own. And you had better hope, based on previous experience, that how you setup the problem is sensible, because there will not be any feedback in terms of lecture about how to solve problems UNLESS you try to find a lecture recorded for some other class that covers the same topic, which can be a hit or miss endeavor. Anyway, as a practical matter for those reading this review, here is my advice. Don\'t watch the lecture and expect it to help you with the homework, the midterm, or the final all that much. Indeed, there is only a limited relationship between the lecture and the things that determine your grade. Instead of focusing too much on the lecture, I would recommend that you focus on the homework problems and consider the lecture but one resource that MIGHT sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the cs-themed math problems that are the bread and butter of this course. As often or not, an outside resource will be more valuable to you than the actual lecture. Do not be surprised by this. For example, at the beginning of the class, I would highly recommend a strong focus on the "optional" Sipser textbook in particular. (Oh, and don\'t be fooled by the syllabus. There is nothing "optional" about the recommended textbooks UNLESS you already own a textbook that is substantial similar. ) In fact, if you are taking CS 6505, why are you even reading this review? You should be reading Sipser. \n\nA note about office hours. In the Fall of 2015, there were two types of office hours. Office hours where lecture was watched together and office hours that covered the homework. As I was taking two classes, I personally did not have time to show up to many "watch together" type office hours. But the few I did go to were not all that useful. But don\'t get confused. If you find the "watch together" office hours less than useful, don\'t make the mistake of assuming (like I did early on), that the office hours are a waste of time. In fact, the office hours that go over the homework are pretty much must watch for most people. Indeed, if I were to take the class over again, the first thing I would do when I received the homework is review it and try to complete as much of it as possible before office hours covering that homework is held. Then you will be well-positioned to maximally benefit from office hours and just maybe, have something resembling a normal life. As others have mentioned, it is in office hours that many of the "hints" to the "tricks" that will otherwise end up consuming your entire life are given. Thus, being properly prepared for office hours is often the only efficient means of solving the homework and the way to steal back some free time from this time-sucking course. So, do not make the mistake I did, which is to insist on watching the lectures before attempting the homework. The lectures (which still are not optional) probably will not help you that much with the homework anyway. Just as often, it will be some third-party source of information that is key. I would also argue if you are a visual learner who likes to learn from seeing others work out problems, that Chris Pryby\'s office hours should not be skipped, since he has a tablet and works out problems. Other TAs often resort to typing out math in chat, which, in my opinion, barely works and is highly inefficient even when it does work. Oh, and if your schedule doesn\'t allow you to make it to office hours one week? At least in the Fall of 2015, too bad. Office hours are not recorded like they should be in order to give everyone the same access to the same information. People who have time in their schedule for office hours will have an information advantage over those who do not. (And this is especially critical, because while the lectures often aren\'t that helpful to solving the homework, midterm, or final, the office hours do cover that sort of information. ) \n\nAnother point. The title of the course Computation, Complexity, and Algorithms. Low and behold, other courses offered at Georgia Tech, but not yet to OMSCS students include Computational Complexity Theory, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Approximation Algorithms, and Randomized Algorithms. CCA includes all of these topics, albeit on a sort of superficial level. You would think that since all of these topics are covered, that the course would focus heavily on the interrelationships between them. But despite some noises in the lectures about such interconnections, that is far from the focus in the class. No or little knowledge of interconnections between these topics will help you in the homework, midterm, or final. Anyway, my experience in this class was essentially this. At just about the time I start feeling comfortable, maybe even competent, dealing with one area, it is time to move on to the next. So, don\'t expect to acquire an especially strong foundation or confidence in any of the topics above as a reward for taking this class (although you should have a reasonable introduction). Maybe the exception is computation, but for that, I would credit the excellent Sipser book, much more than this class. Also, the earlier lectures are much better than later lectures. \n\nAnyway, I am nearly done with my rant. As you might infer from the tone, I did not much like this class. My view is that it is too much work for too little return. Something to be endured, not enjoyed. If CCA were a stock, I would sell it short. But that said, if you take this class, you will learn a lot. It is just that you will have to put in a disproportionate amount of work in learning it. (I feel I would have benefitted more from self-study, where I would control the agenda. ) In terms of grading, you can expect low scores that are then generously curved. But in the end, as a practical matter, much of the class is nearly as much of a test of pre-existing knowledge and mathematical skills as anything else, especially when it comes to setting up problems or figuring out the cute "tricks" necessary to get to the end. (And it shouldn\'t have to be said, but knowing how to setup the problem is probably 50% of the challenge. So focus on that first. ) And while I have seen classes that grade on a curve being well-done, in this case, I believe the curve disguises the fact that the course designers do not have a particularly clear agenda regarding what skills and knowledge they actually expect students to acquire from the class. It is more of, lets test them on a bunch of stuff and see what sticks sort of thing. A curve can (in theory) be the most fair way to grade students; but it can also be a way of concealing flawed course design. In this particular case and for this particular class, I believe it is the latter not the former. \n\nNow, there is a particular sort of person that enjoys this class. And without exception, I believe that what sets those people apart is that they are very well-prepared in terms of mathematics and perhaps in terms of schedule (probably they are only taking one course). As I have said, neither the mathematics nor the insights in the course are all that hard, in retrospect. But what is hard is the amount of material you are expected to cover with inadequate time to cover it systematically and thoroughly due to the lack of a focused and clear learning agenda. For those who come into the course with very solid skills (such that they probably do not even need to take the course, really), then it is a pretty fun problem-solving experience. Maybe it even hits the sweet spot for optimal learning. For everyone else who is going to take this course, I do not believe that you will find this course to be anywhere close to enjoyable or a great use of your time relative to the reward. I certainly did not enjoy the class or feel that it is was a good use of my time. But then again, I am not a math major. Perhaps if I had been one, I would have enjoyed this course too.',

    body: 'This is a very fun course that is heavily project-based, and most of the projects are at least partially open-ended. The assignments are a mix between structured programming assignments that implement specific algorithms covered in the lectures and non-programming assignments that involve more of a focus on photography and using software to manipulate your photos. For most of the assignments completing the assignment as specified correctly only earns a 90% score (which is the cutoff for an A grade in this course) and you are on your own to figure out some way to go "above and beyond" to earn the last 10%. I really liked this aspect of the course because it let me pursue my own ideas and experiment with the material from the course on my own. There is also an open-ended final project that can be done individually or as a group, and a final exam. The final exam does a good job covering all of the material from the course and is open-notes, so if you understand the material in the course you should be able to get a good score on it. The overall workload of the course is flexible, especially if you try to go above and beyond for every assignment, and in general you will be rewarded for putting a lot of effort into the course even if your end results are not amazing. \n\nIn terms of what you should know going into the course, general Python and numpy experience will be helpful since there is a fairly large amount of programming in the course, although for the most part the assignments mainly involve understanding how to apply the algorithms from the course rather than involving much complex code. Being familiar with the math used in the course is also very helpful (especially matrix operations which are heavily used) although the lectures do an excellent job of explaining things. Also having a high quality camera is not required, but having a camera that has manual settings for things like exposure time makes many of the photography-based significantly assignments easier (as does having a tripod for your camera). The lectures do not assume any previous knowledge about photography, digital images, or the algorithms used in the course, but those topics are covered in a lot of detail so there is a lot to learn from this course. \n\nOverall I would say if you are interested in photography and image manipulation and want to get some practical experience with both this is a great course.',

If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course). \n\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas. \n\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.',

    body: "It was a very challenging course yet I enjoyed it very much. I did some theoretical computer science research during my undergraduate study. Therefore I am quite familiar with the all the course materials yet still it's very challenging for me. \n\nThe first half of the course was about Turing Machine, Decidable, Recognisable and NP-complete, NP-hard. It requires very strong math proving skills. It's ok if you don't understand these concepts prior to the class. Nevertheless, you should be comfortable with reading the proof and checking if one proof is correct or not and writing proofs you know for sure is correct. If you don't know whether you can do these, try to prove quick-sort is O(n^2) in the worst case and is O(nlogn) in expectation. Try to prove that fibonacci series equation\nF_n = (a^n-(-a)^(-n))/sqrt(5), where a = (1+sqrt(5))/2 by mathematical induction. Also the HW0 is somewhat similar to these problems. If you are not comfortable with HW0, drop the course immediately. \n\nThorough out the first half of the course, you should find that most proving problems follow a pattern. For example, how to prove something is undecidable, you reduce it to HALT. how to prove something is decidable, you find a decider. How to prove something is NP-Complete, you first prove it's in NP by providing a verifier verifies the instance in polynomial time and second you reduce the problem to some known NP-Complete problem. As long as you follow the proving patterns, you are in the right direction. Google for solutions of the homework also helps but make sure you understand it and then close the webpage and write your own proof and cite the website in the homework. \n\nThe second half of the course focuses on solvable problems and polynomial time algorithms. While implementing the algorithm is mandatory in the homework, it still places most of the attention on proving the algorithm is correct and analysing the time complexity. Some basic graph concepts and algorithms like bfs, dfs and shortest path will help. Learning these algorithms doesn't mean you can implement the algorithm. Instead, it means you know how to prove the correctness of the algortihm (like what I said, you know for sure your proof is valid) and you know how to analysis the time complexity. \n\nThe homework is hard but try doing all homework including the bonus as much as possible. I particularly enjoy the moment when I solve the problem after 3 hours intensive thinking. Also, I personally think it's better to handwrite all the homework so that writing proof for middle exam and final exam won't be uncomfortable. I don't have much suggestions for the exams. Try doing your best. \n\nHope you all doing well on this course.",

Professor and TA's are great and goes above and beyond to help (they held office hours on weekends!). Overall, it's a good class but have room for improvement.",

They will add quite a bit of additional time while only affecting your grade by about 1% each. \n\nLectures/Tests\nThe lectures are a little slow paced. I watched most of them on speed-and-a-half, which increased my focus considerably. The midterm and final ask detailed questions from the lectures and also contain quite a bit of application material.

    body: "It's pretty hard for me to give an accurate commentary on this class because I have such an unusual background, but I can only really give advice that would be applicable to the general population interested in taking this course. About 35-40% of the students will drop, and this has been consistent throughout the terms so far. General programming experience almost doesn't even matter, but having the right experience does. People with 10 years of programming experience struggled. For reference, I had maybe worked a job using a higher level language than C for about a few months before taking this course, and most of my academic and job experience was fairly nontechnical in nature. I did not even graduate in STEM. \n\nOf course, understanding C is necessary to do well, but I can promise you that not knowing C is NOT the primary limitation that most people will suggest. Being able to take a spec, design a solution, test it thoroughly, and refactor to apply the right patterns are far more indicative of whether or not you will succeed in this course. I didn't find the programming assignments particularly difficult, but a lot of people struggled against the autograder so a bit of gusto for debugging would certainly help you as well. You should still start the projects early so that you can let the ideas marinate in your head as you're going about your daily routine. The tests were nothing to write home about; just your standard review of the details will do. What helped me most was taking screenshots of key video stills into OneNote and maybe writing a few supplemental notes to jot down specifics as I listened along at 2x speed. That workflow was sufficient enough for me to grasp the material. \n\nGoing by the reviews, this, Machine Learning, and Algorithms are by far the most time-consuming classes. I heard somewhere that AOS was easier, but the statistics seem to reflect an equivalent success rate (~40% drop). All of these classes will expect different things out of you, and this course in particular should challenge your programming abilities relative to other courses. Operating Systems classes are notorious for having the most legitimate programming assignments, whereas Algorithms on the other end of the spectrum expect you to have a higher level of mathematical maturity and the ability to write proofs, which fewer people possess. I CAN give advice on the latter, but this is not the review for that :)\n\nInstructor and TA support was pretty top notch from what I saw, although this won't be the case for every single course in the program. So I would take the course just because the experience was well made and well-supported, but definitely make sure that you have the right background before signing up!",

It really does require knowledge of about 36 white papers in order to answer the questions on the exams. I came across 3 questions on each of them that i had no idea what paper they came from, let alone what they were referring to. I spent days cramming, and re-watching the lectures. \n\nThe projects are not impossible, but are very time-consuming in order to write, debug and get to pass auto-grader, and corner-case testing, however, given enough time (2-3 weeks) you can complete them. I completed 2 of 4 with A's but they took 40+ hours to get that over 3 weeks. I am a novice C programmer, so that was my downfall. I'm sure others with a high level of C programming did them in half or less time, but they are covering subjects and APIs that we are given and forced to use, that come with no instructions, we had to fumble about them to figure out how to use them correctly. \n\nIOS will help, if you are not fluent with C. Overall this is definitely one of the harder classes in the program, BUT I did learn a lot, and I'm a better C programmer because of it. \n\nOH one more weird thing... the PIAZZA participation grade (3% overall), seems to be based on an algorithm of Days logged on, posts read, and contributions. The number one contributor gets a 3, everyone else gets something less. There were just a few days difference between our top two contributors (600+ posts each), and one got a 3, while the other got a 2. 9. I had 87 days, 479/607 read, and 58 contributions, and scored a 1. 2 out of 3 points.",

    body: "This is a very difficult class. I spent at least 30 hours a week on homework, and I have a CS/Math background. Some things I'd recommend before beginning the class:\n\n* Get familiar with mathematical notation. I spent lots of time early on just trying to figure out how to read and understand the assignments, let alone work through solutions. \n* Familiarize yourself with basic proof methods (induction, direct, contradiction). Luckily I had an old discrete math book from undergrad lying around that was very helpful in the beginning weeks of the course. It's also worth skimming over general topics in discrete math (and probably some from graph theory as well). \n\nI can't emphasize enough how little free time I had during this class. I had time to go to work, come back home and study/do homework for 3-4 hours, and then go to bed. I also spent most weekends working on homework. 16 weeks of this is draining--I can't imagine doing this with a family and/or other obligations. However, the work I put in definitely paid off. I was able to get over 100% as my homework average, which balanced out a mediocre performance on the final. I ended up with an A (barely). \n\nLectures:\nThe lectures for this class were very hit and miss for me. I really enjoyed the first half of the class, and thought the lectures did a better job of thoroughly explaining the concepts. The second half of the class was less enjoyable for me. The lectures seemed to assume a very strong background in linear algebra and didn't work through examples at some crucial points (thinking specifically of the linear programming lectures). I took linear algebra in undergrad and so that part wasn't so bad, but the lack of examples on things like the Simplex method really made things difficult. Don't try to breeze through the lectures. When watching, I would rewind a portion 3 or 4 times with pencil and paper in front of me. If I didn't understand a concept, I'd rewatch until I could write it out in my own words. This helped in the long run, but was excruciatingly slow. There were several times, especially during the second half of the semester, that consulting Google for lecture notes from other programs was beneficial. If you do this, make sure you cite your source if you're working on homework. \n\nHomework:\nFor me, the homework in this class was the most valuable part of the class. Dr. Pryby's assignments were extremely difficult (hours and hours of work), but they forced you to understand the concepts in the lectures, and stretched you to think deeply about the topics. The feeling you get when you figure out that key piece of insight is amazing. This is where you should really focus your efforts. It is possible to get > 100 as your homework average if you work hard enough, and this can help pick up crucial slack for the midterm and final. The only real complaint I have about the homework is that sometimes the solutions were not presented very well. I'd prefer to see solutions in as dumbed-down terms as possible so that the class can easily follow how a particular solution was derived. Go to as many office hours as you can--occasionally I didn't think I needed any help on a homework, but joined anyway and the TA would basically give you the answer, or give you an insight that made you change your answer for the better. \n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this review, it's to start the homework early. Being able to grind away at a proof over the course of 2 or 3 days is just not something you can pack into an hours long window (unless you're a math whiz). Give yourself enough time to really think about the problems. Write an answer out, then come back to it a few days later and see if it makes sense. \n\nTests:\nThe tests were extremely stressful. Unless you're a genius, you probably aren't going to finish all of the problems. You have 3 hours to complete 8 to 10 problems, some of which are formal proofs. That gives you 18 to 22 minutes on each problem. One strategy I adopted was to go through the entire test and work on problems that I immediately had insight on. It's not worth spending 30 minutes on a problem you just don't get, and then missing a problem that you might have been able to quickly grasp. The reality for me was that in a timed situation, I was either going to immediately have some insight into the problem, or I wasn't (and if I didn't get it immediately, spending 10-20 minutes on it was not likely to help). I felt absolutely terrible after both tests, but the average turned out to be in the 40s or 50s for each one, so as long as you meet or exceed the average, you should be fine. Another tip--the graders *want* to give you points. Write down _anything_, even if you know it's not totally right or if it seems silly. You never know--you might end up getting a fraction of a point. And for this class, every little bit helps. \n\nPart of the stress for me with the tests was the ProctorTrack system that was used. I was terrified that my internet connection would drop, someone would come in the room, or some other infraction would occur and I'd fail. \n\nGrading/Administration:\nThis is only my second class, but the TAs all were very helpful, I thought. They were empathetic with students and were encouraging during office hours. They held frequent office hours and had \"watch together\" sessions. They were also very available on Piazza (at least compared to the other class I've taken). Dr. Pryby was also fairly active on Piazza. One feedback that I think most students had was that the office hours should be recorded. There was some pushback from the instructors on this, but maybe they'll change it in future semesters. \n\nAs for the grading--for a class involving writing proofs, I thought the grading was quite fair. If you think about it, any error in a proof makes the entire proof totally invalid. From this perspective, getting partial credit is generous. Show all of your work, and if you're not sure if you should include or explain something--just go ahead and do so. This should go without saying, but participate in as much extra credit as you possibly can. You need every point you can muster. \n\nBooks:\nJust go ahead and get both of them. At some points during the semester, I needed a combination of book + videos to understand the concepts. In many cases, the books were much clearer than the lectures. CLRS is probably worth having on your bookshelf anyway. \n\nConclusion:\nThis was a very rewarding class. I feel like the my knowledge of the foundations of computing is now very solid. At the same time it was extremely stressful. I wouldn't recommend taking it and expecting an A if you have other life commitments. Good luck!",

    body: "50% of students got a C or less (and that's after many students withdrew following the midterm results). Of course each student is responsible for his/her own grade, but there's a problem if half the students are essentially failing the course. Expect a lot of outside study of the material. The lectures are barely useful. They gloss over the material and give no concrete examples that are on par with the homework. These are some of the shortest lectures of any OMSCS course I've taken (out of 6) and this is the hardest of any of the OMSCS courses by far. That's a problem. I also think the level of mastery expected by the professor is unreasonable in a single course. There should be a prerequisite for this course. The difficulty is just unreasonable for students that are new to the material. It sounds like earlier professors were more reasonable about this and graded accordingly. \n\nMy advice? Until they resolve this situation, skip this one and take the \"Interactive Intelligence\" specialization.",

The video lectures are great and entertaining for an introduction course to Computer Vision. The questions and answers are mostly managed by students with some participation from the TAs.

I strongly recommend watching all the videos even if the problem sets don't require them. This will help you in your final as it covers more units than the PS. \n\nThe instructor is mostly absent during the course. We got a welcome, a good-bye, and a few messages in between.

    body: "This is course is very challenging, but you will learn a tremendous amount about the various topics covered. This semester had the absolute best TA / Prof interaction in any OMS course. There were literally office hours every single day. I spent a lot of time working on this course (at least 20 hours per week), and I did have a CS undergrad for what it's worth (its almost 8 years old). \n\nThe grading scheme is 1/3 homework, 1/3 midterm and 1/3 final. The homework assignments are very challenging, and often times the mean score for an assignment was around 10-11 of 16. There were opportunities for extra credit to improve the homework score. A small minority of these problems are python programming assignments. This should not be your focus in preparation. \n\nThe questions on the midterms and final are easier than the homework, but they are timed and I was unable to attempt all problems on either test. This was very common among other students as well. The mean grades for the exams were in the 50s. The grades are all \"curved\" for lack of a better term to be normalized to a standard 10 point grade bracketing. \n\nYou will definitely want to prepare ahead of time for the course. Some things I wish I had studied prior (and other useful topics):\nMathematical Notation : Summation, Dot Product, etc\nSet Theory\nGraph Theory\nAsymptotic Runtime Analysis (Big-O notation)\nTime Complexity Classes\n\nI highly recommend you check out the lectures on the public Udacity site prior. While they won't necessarily prepare you for the assignments, if you can't understand the notation used in the lectures, you should review it until you do. \n\nOne thing I will mention regarding some of the other reviews: there is a very specific academic integrity guideline when it comes to using outside resources (not the lectures or prescribed textbooks). We had some significant issues with plagiarism concerns on one of the homeworks which led to some grades being lowered to 0. Just follow it to a T and you should have no problem using outside resources to help with the homework problems.",

If you already have a group of people for your project this class could be good and easy, but with the unequal work amongst the group it can be very hard for the people who are doing all the work on the project.',

    body: "This course ended up being much more time consuming than I had originally expected. A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n1. Feedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know. \n\n2. Group projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group",

    body: 'This is your warning: steer clear of this class. If at all possible, avoid taking it until the instructors have raised the quality bar. \n\nComputer Networks is an interesting and important field of study within Computer Science. This is knowledge that you should gain. Unfortunately, the structure and presentation of this class is incredibly frustrating and ambiguous. You still really struggle to get an A in this class because the class is poorly designed. The content isn\'t inherently challenging. The class is just designed to make it hard to do well. \n\nLectures: the lectures are quite poor and disorganized. There is no clear thread tying them together and complex concepts pop up and vanish again for the remainder of the course within a single breath... until they show up later on a quiz (more below). The lecture content has tremendous breadth but is frequently covered at such a shallow and unclear level that it is practically useless. If you want to spend hours reading Wikipedia articles, trying to understand what the professor is trying to teach, take this course. \n\nTests/quizzes: oh boy... most quizzes are "select all of the correct responses" style. Which means that 6-question quizzes essentially entail digging for minutia in order to discount even a single potential response. Prepare yourself for hours of Google + Wikipedia + watching random YouTube videos in the hope of uncovering a kernel that may/may not help you answer the question. Frequently, the wording on quizzes was so ambiguous that Piazza was flooded with questions and office hours were spent asking the instructor to clarify the same question over and over again. What seems like an easy "1 quick quiz per week or two" turns into a 3-4 day treasure hunt with the hope that an instructor might properly explain the intent of a question/answer option. \n\nProjects: the only good part of this course. The projects were occasionally a bit trivial but gave some programming practice in Python and helped to give a few concepts the depth of understanding that they deserve. Even the projects though were fraught: the instructors had to make the last project optional since so many people weren\'t able to understand it/make it run on their virtual machines. \n\nI\'ll repeat it again: this class is not inherently challenging. From previous semesters, it looks like this class was "take this if you want an A" easy. Instead of making projects more challenging or treating the content at any additional depth, the instructors simply made it more difficult to get an A. This course is difficult because of ambiguity, a lack of depth and poor assessments. \n\nIn case you were wondering, these concerns were raised to the instructors multiple times on Piazza throughout the semester. Each time, they were met with a shrug or a reason why the students\' concerns were invalid. For me, this exemplifies a lack of awareness and understanding among the instructors for students who are just trying hard to learn. \n\nKeep in mind that I\'m currently scoring in the 85%+ range. I put in a lot of time for this class. I wish I could have invested that time elsewhere.',

    body: "I had previously taken the class when it was offered on Udacity as a MOOC before it became a \"for-credit\" class at GT. It's exactly the same. I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not. \n\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily. \n\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\n\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class. \n\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.",

    body: "The material is easy enough to understand and given a 'full length' semester, this class would be much more enjoyable. I took it in the Summer Semester and it was definitely 'jam packed', requiring my full-time attention. I would recommend the class during either the normal Fall or Winter schedules, but not during the reduced timeframe Summer schedule. My '30 hours per week' would probably be less had the course been spread over the normal amount of time. \n\nI would seriously recommend either taking the CP or CV class before taking this class or have a decent amount of experience using Python's PIL image module. Without this background, you'll be at a disadvantage with the projects. I spent a lot of time learning image processing and went down a lot of dead-ends on my projects because I wasn't prepared for the visual processing aspect of the projects. IMHO, taking CP or CV should be a prerequisite of the class, or at least strongly encouraged. \n\nDavid Joyner is an excellent and enthusiastic teacher, unlike some in this program who seem totally 'checked-out'. He actively participates in the forums and discussions and adds a lot to the educational experience.",

You will definitely learn a lot if you take it, both in terms of how to think about financial data, some financial concepts, how to work with Python libraries (especially NumPy and Pandas), and some machine learning topics. \n\nI think this course would be a great course to take before Machine Learning, because it introduces you to the topic of machine learning in a more gentle manner than the Machine Learning course. I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay. \n\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over. \n\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule.',

This is a fine course and most will enjoy it very much- I certainly did. The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester. \n\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it!",

The assignments got a bit tedious- 20 assignments in the semester administered as quizzes on T-square, so more than 1 per week. They don\'t take very long to do, but I didn\'t feel like I learned much from any of them nor did they test my knowledge very well. They were simple true/false, multiple choice, and fill in the blank questions that basically just took a random sentence from the textbook or lecture and made it into a question. There were a few instances of the "correct" answer conflicting with other sources, or differences between the book and the lecture. The midterm was structured the same as these assignments, so it was just your ability to spit out random tidbits (mostly from the book). \n\nAll in all its a good course.',

I have a minor exposure to linear algebra, and a strong exposure to calculus and I still found most of the math over my head. Some things that would be good to know ahead mathmatically: eigenvalues, gradients, sum of square differences, minor exposure to supervised and unsupervised machine learning, physic in motion and illumination, signal and frequencies, and of course the basic matrices and vector operations. The problem sets are the core of your grade and will vary in time commitment. I found ps1, ps4, ps5, ps6 to be the most time consuming having to work over 20 hours on each. The problem sets focused on creating the algorithms for the computation as well as modifying them to optimize your results, so it could get frustrating tweeking the inputs and variable of your algorithms. The professor of the lectures definitely knows his stuff when it comes to CV and a bit of his personality made the lectures very enganging. It's important to take notes for the lectures because at the end of the course there will be an exam and it is a pain have to go back through all the lectures as it was for me. The exam seemed fair. The instructor and TAs are helpful on piazza. And of course other students were very helpful. The office hours were helpful as well, I only had one problem with an office hour where I was the only student there and the TA was very unresponsive, but that was the exception to the rule. Take this course if you want to become interested in Computer Vision because you will once you take this course.

    body: "I have somewhat of a differing opinion of the previous answers. At first, I thought the class was really cool. You learn how to write a program that models human intelligence. You learn many different concepts of knowledge representation, problem solving, and machine learning. In the first project, you learn how to write a program to solve basic IQ test style questions. However, there are 4 projects in the class, and each project is just the same project, just with harder IQ questions. Grading is completely results based (how many did it solve?), so in the interest of solving as many problems as I could, I have not delved deep into the advanced concepts that we have learned in lecture, because if you're even somewhat busy, you're just going to apply the concepts that will solve the most problems in the least amount of time it takes to write (instead of spending the time to apply as many concepts as it takes to solve all the problems). I would much rather have the class have slightly smaller projects that are different each time (like the problems covered in the lectures are way more interesting to me) more specialized toward a concept that forces you to apply new concepts. Another problem I have with this class is the sheer amount of writing we have to do. I've never taken an engineering class where we literally have to write a paper every week. The amount of writing isn't much, but as someone who has gotten used to writing only for project reports, it really sucks.",

Also, on the weeks that a midterm or a project isn't due, you have to write mini papers on how you would apply one of the many techniques to the project. Just be sure to keep up with lectures the best you can, stay involved in the class and don't procrastinate. In the early weeks, I think I spent more time on my agent just because I was a bit unsure but there have been weeks that I spent 5 hours on the class.

You do not need to have any previous AI experience to take this course, and it's not very math-heavy compared to other AI courses I have taken. You will also have a much easier time on the projects if you are proficient in writing Python or Java code, a lot of the project involves coming up with and trying your own ideas for algorithms so being able to implement a new idea quickly is helpful.

If you attempt to implement using one of the more advanced techniques, you will likely get a little discouraged on the actual result. Therefore, most people stayed with brute force algorithmatic approach. Warning, if you never had image processing related experience, the visual compoenent will be more involved!

That said, I feel like I didn't learn that much especially considering the amount of work I put in. Nothing was very difficult, but it was very time consuming. I'd venture that you could put in much less work and still do well. The programming projects are interesting, but become repetitive. As alluded to above, if you have some algorithmic development under your belt, you can do better than average without even thinking about a KBAI algorithm. There was a *ton* of writing for the class. I think I will hit 80 pages of turned in essays/design reports/exams. This semester there were 5 1000 word essays, 4 1500 word design reports, and 2 ~2500 word exams. However, I think you'd be hard pressed to cover the questions in the depth required by the rubric at those lengths; I was usually at least double the suggested length. Mostly these assignments are rehashing lecture material at a high level. I think this course would have been much better had they selected 3-4 topics and gone in depth on each with a tailored project.",

One neat thing they do in this class is list and save exceptional submissions. Unlike the above comment, I thought this was a good introductory course for a broad amount of material.

Goel and Joyner are very serious about the course and very skilled at course management, meaning that you get a clear notion of what you ought to be doing to succeed, and how you are supposed to use the various tools (Piazza, lectures,... ) effectively. It also means that you get great feedback through the peer review system, and timely assignment grades (which was a problem in my other course). They work to stagger due dates and they publish all due dates at or near the beginning of the term (in the initial syllabus, in fact), which makes it possible for you to plan well if you have other classes or major work commitments. \nIn terms of learning, you get out of the class more or less what you put into it. I didn't have time to implement the number of alternative algorithms I really wanted to on the projects (particularly the later ones), but that wasn't necessary to get a decent grade. \nIn terms of the subject matter, I loved what the course covered, but I am biased since AI is my area of particular interest. I felt that coding the agent was fun but that students without some prior exposure to image processing datastructures were at a disadvantage. \nYou will find this class easy if you: are efficient and good at expressing ideas in writing, are fluent at coding in Java or Python, and have sat in on an image processing course at some point in time (it's fine if you think you've forgotten everything). \nIf one of those doesn't hold true for you, expect to put in a bit more time than my estimate.",

I'll list the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Excellent TA and instructors, obviously cared about the class, very very involved in Piazza, and excellent to talk to. \n2. Easy A. Projects are not that hard if you're confident in programming, and are really easy in terms of grading. Last two projects had means in the 60s(which is also the threshold for an A), and I ended with grades in the high 80s with a couple of hours of effort. \n\nCons:\n1. Way too many things. I don't really understand why you need 4 projects, 5 assignments, a midterm and a final?? Oh wait and also peer feedback/participation. I spent way too much time on this class for nowhere close to enough gain. \n2. Grading is a joke. \n a. Project grading is virtually completely based on how many problems your agent solves, which de-incentivzes you to try anything creative. \n b. Assignment/midterm/final grading is absurd. I did well on them all, but it seems to completely arbitrary. I would get a below mean grade on an assignment with a comment 'Good job', or points docked off with no explanation, or a really good score on an obviously half-assed assignment. \n3. Peer feedback is quite useless. Started off well for maybe one assignment, after which point it became obvious that people were just doing it to get your participation grade, and not really reading the assignments. Not to mention they made it compulsory to do peer feedback for assignments that you didn't even attempt. \n4. Content is useless. Ah, this was my biggest gripe with this course. The material taught in the class did not seem practical at all. Maybe I'm amazingly misunderstanding the course material, but it seems to be mostly common sense that they somehow manage to come up with more and more terminology for. And I don't mean trying to understand how common sense works, no, I mean the concepts that they understand seemed hardly worthy of a class. If you look at any practical AI, it's machine learning and mathematical approaches. I think I learned absolutely nothing in this class. \n5. Projects are unrelated to course content. I got excellent grades on all the projects, but I saw basically no relation to the content taught in the class. I would have done equally well had I not watched a single video(except for the project report, where I had to shoehorn concepts to the actual project)",

Visual isn't much harder, is way more fun and less annoying, saves you from redoing things later and gives you more time to fine-tune your agent. Also, if it's all the same to you, between Java and Python, pick Python. Those guys seem to get way more useful library methods for image processing than the Java camp.",

Your code is worth zero points; your analysis is all that matters. So do not spend time writing code, spend it writing the analysis. They are very secretive about the midterm and final. The test format is like any other college test, but they are hard - you probably cannot get the right answers by intuition during the test, even if you are very familiar with the topics; the answers tend to require reasoning abstractly under time pressure (although less time pressure on the final). Exam grading is very coarse - as though it's done by the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld, earning zero points for the slightest provocation. Everyone should take this course.",

The time-consuming aspect is usually learning how to do techniques needed for the assignment in Weka or another program, then actually running all of the experiments and collecting the data, before you can even start writing the 10+ page paper. If you try to procrastinate and wait until the last few days to start an assignment, you will not do well in this course. The exams are tough but fair, if you remember and understand everything from the lessons you should be able to answer everything without getting stuck, although the midterm was purpsosely designed to not give you enough time to complete it so don't waste too much time on any given question. I would say the one downside of this course is that it will take up too much time if you have commitments outside of this program and are taking another time-consuming course.

The time commitment comes from the papers you have to write. You dont actually write any machine learning algorithms. You download prepackaged algorithms, run them on non-trivial datasets and write papers comparing their performance and drawing conclusions.

Needed to pull from old tests from other universities. \n\nUgly - Inconsistant grading of projects. Some received feedback of points off based on a rubric, some got only comments without telling where points where deducted and some got nothing at all. Felt some graders were tougher then others as I could tell several different grading styles. Either I had an easy grader for my third project or I got someone else's grade as it was my worst paper of the four but my highest grade.

I certainly enjoyed the material. The lectures are a lot of fun and engaging, and surprisingly clear for the concepts presented. However, there was a big gap between the lectures/reading and the assignments, which to me felt like they really aimed to teach you how to do this type of work for yourself. Much of the learning required for the assignments was on your own. It would have been nice to have some kind more help (i. e. , domain knowledge) to get us going. Exams were mostly about 'synthesis', i. e. , demonstrating your knowledge/recall of the material through writing. reading all of the readings was very helpful for exams, but very time-consuming as well. As someone said, if you work full time, kiss all of your free time (and family time, and chore time, and etc. , time) goodbye! Good class, but put a strain on my marriage and/because it prevented me from mothering my kid.",

The semester was like a boot camp where I'm constantly doing projects dued on Sundays, squeezing 30+ hours of coding into each Fri/Sat/Sun. I seriously contemplated about dropping this class at least twice due to the amount of time required. I'm glad I didn't. This class was definitely the hardest that I've ever taken, and the most satisifying to complete. The lectures are top notch. I had to watch most video at least twice to understand them. They grade very slowly, and offer no feedback on test results. Grading on tests is tough. I used Java exclusively, but I think the more popular industrial tools are in Python or R. If taking two classes, take it with an easy one. I'm keeping all my projects for personal future reference. Good luck, have fun.",

I utilized many outside resources for this (there are excellent resources out there). So, overall, it didn't really feel like a course, more like a reference. Looking things up that you know are on a video is hard to do, though. Office hours were inconsistent, too, and it was really hard to get my questions answered (I used stackexchange often to look things up). Since the class was so vague, I felt like I was guessing at what concepts I needed to know. I'm for independent learning, but it doesn't make sense to me in the context of a class with deadlines.

The assignments are painfully long and the grading is so frustratingly inconsistent. Most of the time a assignment requires to solve twice the same problem for no other reason than to take up your time. There is so much material covered that we learn everything to a very shallow level and the math that everybody seems to be scared about is never used during the assignments nor during the exams (which makes the math requirements quite low I think). This being said, I have learned so much during this class and that makes a very effective foundational class for the rest of the master.

Its a fine strategy, and it does force the students to learn themselves with effort. As to the assignments, there were parts of them that I really enjoyed, but mostly they were just a lot of work to do. The parts that I enjoyed were where I had a flash of inspiration and was able to come up with applciations of the problems to solve things that I found cool, but without those flashes just meant that you are spending hours and hours thinking about random datasets that aren't really that exciting. The assignments are very open ended, and they basically just say 'Answer all of the questions that you can think of about [something]', but do note that there are specific requirements that you are graded against, you just don't get to see them in advance. This didn't impact me very much, but I know that others were annoyed that they lost points for something that wasn't specifically called out as a requirement. The TAs went through bursts of being responsive, but then we wouldnt hear much for weeks. Oh, and the peer review system that they set up was worthless. They said it was optional, but then mandated that you could only get answers from TAs about your grading through the peer review system (so much for optional), and the peer feedback came too late to help with anything.",

Be prepared to run through assignments multiple times to contribute very little to your actual assignment writing. On the tooling side, I ended up using R, Python, Java and MATLAB. I would say the best idea is to be comfortable on many different platforms, and pick the one which you feel will solve the problem the easiest. It is a matter of choosing the best tool for the situation. With that in mind I think that it is essential to at least know a little bit of Java for assignment 2 using the ABAGAIL library, since MIMIC algorithm is not really implemented anywhere else. (MIMIC is based on an algorithm which is the subject of Charles' research). Be prepared for learning curve on the tools that you will use, because at least for me I ended up trying many different tools for my assignments, before settling on one. \n\nOverall, I have enjoyed the course and have learnt a lot.",

The assignments are very open ended, so open ended that it began to hurt my head on how I should proceed to do my assignments, I wanted them to be good, but at the same time reasonable to solve. (In retrospect I would go with making easier problems rather than flashier, more intricate problems). Basically, this was an excellent way to learn how to implement a machine learning problem in the practical sense. If the assignments are the practical side of ML, then the exams were the thereotical side. The midterm was hard, I couldn't even finish the whole test, this is expected so it is generously curved, they are also very lenient with grading it, so move fast on the midterm. I just finished the final and didn't find it to be as difficult as the midterm. I enjoyed both tests. And although the implementations of the algorithms were not required to be done for the course, the algorithms were given in class and left to the student to implement himself if he wanted to. I was not too fond of this at first, but realized that I learned more about the behavior of data and machine learning algorithms by seeing how they worked in a practical sense. If one wants to learn more indepth about how algorithms should be implemented look at the Coursera. com course on Machine Learning, which I also highly recommend. I am excited for the new reinforcement course taught by the same professors in the Fall. Its good to know Java and Python for this class.

At least for me, they were a joy to watch over and over again, which really helped those concepts simmer in my head (which, in turn, really helped with the final). The exams were also really fun and reflected both the high caliber of intellect and the wicked sense of humor found in the videos. \nI watched the lectures through once before taking the class - however, in retrospect, I would have been better off picking some good datasets for the assignments. Don't make my mistake and spend 20 hours during the course processing your music library into a dataset! Go into the course with 2-3 good datasets selected - datasets which are manageable enough that a neural net can do something meaningful with them. They link https://archive. ics. uci. edu/ml/datasets. html in the syllabus - you could also try http://mldata. org/ and https://bitly. com/bundles/bigmlcom/4. \nI used Weka, ABAGAIL, ABAGAIL and BURLAP respectively for the four assignments. Note that these required virtually no coding. They encourage you to do as little coding as possible for the assignments, and they are serious about this. Unfortunately, they had very specific grading criteria which they didn't share in advance of the assignment submission, particularly for the first one. It also took an insane amount of time to turn around the assignments - I got back assignment 1 on the day assignment 2 or 3 was due. Because of this it took me some time to even understand what they were looking for in the papers. \nOn the flip side, their final grades were quite forgiving, and if you had a good score on the final and the last assignment they erred on the side of giving you a higher mark. So don't let the grading scare you away.",

    body: "Disclaimer: I've done the Andrew Ng machine learning MOOC and have a personal interest in machine learning, so 50-60% of the class was not new to me. \n\nThat said, I found this class fairly easy. For both material I had seen and not seen before, Prof. Isbell and Prof. Littman did a great job of presenting the ideas, intuition, and some degree of mathematical formalism. If only my classes in undergrad were so entertaining! Maybe there were a few things that I didn't know, such as algorithms and complexity, but nothing a little Googling couldn't solve. The lecture videos take maybe 4 hours a week, with some pausing. What really kills the brain is some of the REALLY long and mathematical reading. My advice: skim, but don't skip the reading. There's a lot of interesting details, not to mention having a broad view of the field of machine learning is quite useful if you want to practice data science. So you have to be efficient. (Read: Data science != Machine learning). \n\nThe tests were fair in my opinion. They did make me think hard about the properties of the methods we studied. But they are long. It's a bit annoying to use the text entry methods on T-Square, especially when Piazza was way better for typesetting math. \n\nProbably as many people will say, the homeworks were incredibly time consuming. On average, the homeworks took me about 40 hours. This includes brainstorming ideas, programming and implementation of algorithms, collecting data, generating graphs and tables, and writing the report. I admit that I'm a pretty slow (bad?) coder, but using Python made it easier. On the other hand, Python has fewer resources and is slower than Java. But that's the practical lesson of the homeworks: balancing speed of implemention, execution time, and effectiveness. Don't make your homework needlessly complicated though, since your goal should be to master the concepts, not programming!\n\nThe recommended book (by Tom Mitchell) was pretty accessible. It's not a criticism of the class, but I thought many of the examples IN THE book were lame or otherwise uninteresting. On the other hand, the chapter introductions and especially summaries were a great review. I would recommend also checking out a few other BOOK s in addition. \n\nLast comment: Piazza is awesome, especially if you are active. I didn't find Hipchat to be very useful since it was a bit too real-time and you couldn't typeset math when you needed to explain equations or what not. I didn't attend any of the office hours.",

I felt that this course was a bit too open-ended at times. \n\nThe lectures are entertaining and informative. \n\nThe assignments are based around performing a series of expiriments and then performing analysis on those expiriments. Neither the lectures nor the assignment instructions go into any real discussion on how to implement the expiriments, you are mostly on your own in that regard. You need to choose what tool or software package to use (WEKA, ABAGAIL, BURLAP, R, SciKit, etc. ) as well as what algorithms and parameters to use in many cases. You are given very little direction on how to perform the expiriments, so they typically take a great deal of time to setup. You are given zero points for implementing the actual expiriment, the grade is based entirely on your analysis of your results. That said, as long as you answer all the questions the assignment poses, the grading tended to be fair. Piazza is your friend here as other students are a good source for what direction to go or not to go for each assignment. \n\nThe exams were also very open-ended and you aren't given much direction on what to study. \n\nOverall if you do all of the assignments, and do more than just watch the lectures and read the book to study you should manage at least a B.",

The structure of the material presentation is what I consider as best - starting with the main idea(s) and presenting it in a simple (but not primitive) and memorable way and then diving into details (technical and rigourous) and then recaping what you've learnt. The level is very good and assignments allow you to make the course as difficult as you want. Some suggestions: To students - 1) follow the assignment rubric carefully, if it says do kurtosis analysis - do it (it's actually not that optional as you might think). If you do a reasonable analysis following rubric fully, you can be almost sure you'll get more than 90% and all the rest will depend on the amount and quality of your analysis. 2) Do all optional work you are given (reviewing assignments, problem sets, etc. ) It will help understand the material and get a better grade. 3) If you want to really succeed on the exams (like solving almost all problems) and it is your 1st ML course, then doing lectures and homework assignments most probably won't be enough. Read the BOOK s and solve some additional problems from other sources. To Profs: 1) it would be great to make problem sets a little closer to the type of questions students will see on the exam (both questions and problems), I felt that they were slightly disconnected sometimes. 2) It would be better to provide more problems in each problem set (even if they are optional). 3) It would be good to see not only midterm exam explained by Profs, but also Final - it is a really important educational piece to know what you did right/wrong on the exam and why.",

Some of the advanced math concepts for the algorithms were challenging, but not essential to understanding how to use the algorithms. The class was very rewarding and I recommend it, but you should plan sufficient time to keep up with the workload. If you fall behind, you would have a difficult time recovering. One other thing that is crucial to the class is the selection of datasets you use for your assignments. Picking a simple dataset won't let you contrast the algorithms, picking too large a dataset will make run-times for the projects extremely long. My recommendation is to find a good large dataset and pair the data down to something that runs in a reasonable time. Don't use small datasets with less than 1000 records.",

The difficulty of this course is it covers a ton of material. It mostly glosses over regression and doesn't address generalized linear models at all, nor does it go into any kind of graph analytics. There is exactly zero discussion of tools and applications. What you get is the kitchen sink of techniques for taking in data and gaining some understanding of it, as well as optimization and optimal control thrown in for good measure. \n\nThe treatment of the math is frankly fairly superficial if you have a decent working intuition of probability and linear algebra. There isn't much discussion of statistics and it would help to supplement what you get here with some outside reading about resampling, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and various loss functions. You need these to analyze the results you get. You don't need to get deep in the weeds with proofs, but understand how and why they work and what you're measuring. \n\nThe biggest thing is don't underestimate the assignments. Don't get cute trying to build web scrapers or pull real-time data from APIs, doing all kinds of feature engineering. Being a data ninja is fun, but this isn't the class for it. You'll get zero extra credit for that. Pick something from the UCI repository that is ready to throw into a train function right away. 100% of the points you get are your analysis. Use well-tested library code on simple datasets and put your effort into visualizing and explaining the performance characteristics of each algorithm, because you need to run quite a few of them. Know what a complexity curve is, a learning curve, a confusion matrix, know what the tuning parameters are for each modeling package and know how and why performance changes when you tweak them. And know the performance measures! Be prepared to explain why you would use accuracy, precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, or whatever measure you use. It's specific to the problem you're trying to solve and this isn't covered in lectures or in the required text, so do some outside study. The package documentation for modeling software usually explains these things pretty well and it isn't complicated, but you'll lose points if you just use straight defaults across the board and can't justify why you chose the resampling technique, parameter tuning strategy, and performance measures you chose.",

It's very, very easy, covering the very basics of portfolio management but only including long and short equity positions, nothing on derivatives, fixed income, FX. If you've used NumPy and pandas before, you can basically sleep through the first month of the course. I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on.

I had very limited experience in C (just from college many years ago) and I mainly use higher level languages like Java, C#, JavaScript and Python at work so diving back into C was a little bit of a challenge. But its very doable, do not get scared just because its C and it has pointers and manual memory allocations. You will be fine. Start your projects early and use the Piazza forums. The students are super helpful and there are always active discussions talking about common bugs or sharing online resources. Use the provided VM! Do not try to write and run programs in your own setup! Its not worth it and will only lead to headache. When you start the projects, break them down into bite size chunks.

Cons (basically all of them are about organization, and indicative of a first-run of the class. they're sure to improve. ) * Grading is slow * The exams seem to need a little work in their wording and alignment with class material. There were many discussions of confusion in the piazza forums after the midterm and one of the midterm questions had to be regraded * If you've never done any C before, you're going to have a huge learning curve on the first project.

The midterm content was no surprise but it was challenging. The projects are easily the biggest time investment. Based on voluntary polls I conducted on G+ students reported spending on average about 40 hours on project one and three, and about 5 hours on average on project 2 and 4. There are also many opportuniteis for extra credit. There are very easy ways to prepare for this course, download an ubuntu linux VM and start writing C that reads and writes from files, sends text and data overa TCP/IP socket, performs string manipulation, and parses command line arguments. These skills were necessary to complete the projects, but not the focus of the project. Despite how much work these projects require, you have plenty of time to start on them (you can start project one on day 1 and it is due 6 weeks in). NOTE: I spent on average 10-15 hours per week, but this is because I worked ahead on light weeks. If you strictly follow the syllabus you will not succeed. For example the first two weeks of the course only took about 2 hours a piece to complete, but I used that time to start project 1 early and it paid off. Start early, use the forums on Piazza, get used to linux and C, and fight the urge to be a perfectionist. It is easy to self induce work on these projects and overwhelm yourself. There is no need to turn in production quality code.",

I do agree with others here that the project descriptions are not very well defined but the office hours really helped in better understanding of what was required. Piazza was exploding with information and discussions with high level of participation from students, TAs and professor Ada. Infact I believe it was piazza discussions that really helped me with the projects. Knowing atleast a bit of C, functions and pointers in C and creating a robust linked list program prior to the course will be very useful. The linked list that I created for project 1, I reused it for project 3. The classes were very well organized and lots of effort and thought has been put into organizing this class.

Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\n\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class?',

I often fell behind on lectures due the amount of time working on projects, and couldn't have imagined taking IOS alongside another class (while working). The lectures are dense but I wouldn't say difficult to grasp, and the exams stick to them quite closely. One qualm is that exam questions are sometimes worded strangely, making them more perplexing than they need to be.

Really impressed with them. The relationship has felt surprisingly personal. Hopefully that persists beyond their first semester. \n\nThe projects can be very time consuming. I echo that you need to know C. Some specific C skills you'll need and are expected to have for Project 1 are the following:\n\n - string manipulation (i. e. , strcpy, strcat, strtok) and understanding/using null-terminated strings\n - use of pointers; nothing too complex like pointer arithmetic, but knowing how to initialize them, malloc space for them, derefence a pointer, and use the address of a variable as a pointer reference\n - general memory functions like malloc, free, memset -- this might be challenging if you've only used more abstract languages like Java and C#; took a while for me to wrap my head around it\n - file I/O: binary read/write, reading a file size (lseek) \n - using proper header files for prototyping (. h files) and (in later projects) incorporating provided. h files to implement APIs\n - creating a basic Makefile to build your application (though after Project 1 they started providing these)\n - creating a queue (linked list) structure and the functions needed to queue and dequeue items in an instance of that structure (again, after Project 1 they provided a library for this; not sure if future iterations of the class would go ahead and throw that in as a resource for the first project)\n\nYou're expected to be able to do the above with only the most basic and standard C libraries. We were allowed to ask if we could use a certain library to complete parts of our projects, but to my knowledge none of the small handful of requests were approved. But once C starts clicking and you get a handle on the basics, you don't really need any special libraries. \n\nThere's also a brief overview early on of how to create a basic web server and web client that communicate over a socket, which you'll have to implement and expand on (every project is a client/server combination). I found it to be a little too basic, but I was also struggling to get my C legs (get it?). I'd recommend that if you're a C noob, you also find a good introduction to connecting to, sending, and receiving over a socket. The first project requires that as part of its functionality, but while there's a lot more to it than that, I found it to be one of the most time-consuming portions. \n\nIf that seems overwhelming, I can say that I started the course with no previous C experience. I had primarily done C# and Java coding prior to taking this class, and I was able to get up to speed. If you have decent coding experience, you'll be fine. You'll just learn how much you take for granted. :) \n\nAs far as the material/exams go, I found that to be very easy to handle. The lectures aren't terribly long, they build on each other well, and (bonus!) they include a lot of fun graphics. I had no former exposure to most of the lesson topics, and I found the majority of the material very accessible. \n\nOh! A lot of people used valgrind and gdb for debugging, as well.",

The instructor has only one solution in mind. But they don't provide you any guidelines. And then you have to spend endless hours trying to figure out what they had in mind. Obviously there are so many other ways to solve the problem. But you're constrained to figure out what to do with the terse and convoluted code skeleton provided without much explanation. And then there's the whole mess of the autograder which only works with the solution they had in mind. Other working solutions might fail the autograder with mysterious messages. The TA's would never acknowledge the problems with the autograder and would always blame it back on the student. The only help they provide is very genericand doesn't help much. At the end of all of it, you're not given any solution guidelines. So you don't really learn what you did wrong and how you could improve. I have professional experience using C for a couple years. C is not the problem. I have a job that requires no more than 40 hours a week. But at the job I have to be intense and sharp. This course has definitely affected my job. All these hours of frustrating project work got to me and it was interfering with my work. I'm not sure I would recommend taking this course if you're full-time employed.

I think the real challenge is coming up with a suitable design to fulfill project objectives. I acknowledge that the autograder can be frustrating at times but it did make me think critically about what I was intending my code to do and what it was actually doing. When I reconciled my design and objectives the autograder would be happy. Secondly, I spent too much time on design and underestimated the amount of testing that was required. The projects are a little thin on specification so it is more or less up to you to devise suitable test cases that match what you think the project objectives are. The marks that I lost in assignments were in hindsight I think due to not thinking more about testing. The problem here is that you will clock a lot of hours.

I would highly recommend starting the projects as soon as they are available to make sure you have enough time to finish them (and try to get it through the autograder). The code skeletons and Udacity autograder are new this semester, as I understand it. I personally enjoyed the projects the most from this class, and while the autograder can be frustrating at times (when the feedback is too vague, or you don't really get any at all), I was always able to find the issue by doing more testing of corner cases myself, which would uncover a crash or deadlock in certain circumstances. The benefit is that you once you've passed the autograder you can be confident that you've done things correctly. I also like the new phased approach to the first project, where you have a few 'build-up' assignments that you should complete before the main project. I personally didn't find the code skeletons a problem or too restrictive, although understanding how it all fits together can be overwhelming at first. By looking at what is given in the skeleton and how certain functions are defined you should be able to figure out how to make everything fit together. Although, I'm not a programmer, so perhaps having some 'embedded direction' is more helpful to me than someone who has a lot more experience.",

So, when people expressed too many conserns with the course, professor responded with the warnings about plagiarizm in homeworks and actually lowered the grades of several students. That worked, and no one complained much sinse. \nPiazza messaging was very active, but mostly from those who were 'lost'.

I actually found the first half of the class easier to understand just because of the shear volume of information in the second part.

There are good resources all over the internet if you don't understand the lectures (sometimes they were confusing), and I recommend (these are Carnegie Mellon courses) material from 21-127, 15-251, 15-451. I'm sure there are other good materials or lectures available, too.",

It's an incredible foundation for Theoretical Computer Science (really, CS as a whole). It's looking like I'll end up with a B, which is okay by me. The workload is highest during the first few weeks, then it slows to a more manageable pace as HWs are due every other week. Not having a strong background in Theory before this course, the HW assignments take me about 12-18 hours each and require some serious thought and effort. The lecture videos are great, but I wouldn't be passing without reading the text BOOK (also great) as well. Exams are fair—difficulty of questions was on par with HW problems, maybe a bit easier—but I didn't have time to finish. Was panicking before I got my (generously) curved grade back. Overall, really fantastic class. High quality course materials. Interesting subject matter. Highly applicable (I'm already seeing the concepts cropping up everywhere I look). Just don't underestimate the time and effort commitment.",

I repeat, the subject matter is very interesting and quite timely to current events like the google SDC. \n\nHowever, to me, who is over half-way through the OMSCS program, this class felt far too simple to be a graduate level course. It was far away the simplest and least time consuming class I've taken. Even though the final project was a group project, I was able to program the primary working code we chose to use in a couple nights and a Saturday. Ironically, the final allowed for algorithms not covered in class. I actually think this would have been more challenging had they required use of only course-covered algorithms (i. e. particle or Kalman Filter) or variants thereof.",

You should get both BOOK s, do further research on the internet, do the supplimental exercises, participate in Piazza, go to office hours, join a study group, etc. But most importantly, just stick it out.

It can be tough if you have bad teammates who dont contribute or MIA. But it's very much doable by one person. You need to research on technique outside of what is taught in the lecture.

    body: "This course was a lot of fun. The lessons focus on very practical methods for solving real-world robotics problems, and theory is often not emphasized as much as implementation. This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.",

They give you an expected solution to match and most of the time, you should be able to reach it. There are quizzes and they do take time to get right. They are not trivial, it requires reading, looking up stuff online and researching to get correctly. Course lectures ARE NOT ENOUGH.

Also, while the quizzes *were* poorly worded and vague (which is unacceptable for any CS class), some students were quite rude to the TAs, who were trying to handle 500 students. I'd echo the sentiments above about the autograder too. GT should provide some automated grading framework like web-cat to handle that load instead of TAs writing custom, fragile auto graders. This way students could validate their code before submitting. I found the lectures very informative, the quizzes at their best made you go learn new things and at their worst confused the heck out of you with vague and imprecise language. I came into the class with zero networking knowledge or Python knowledge and I came out with an A. Don't take it expecting to learn Python. The most complex code you'll write is a loop. I do feel like the lectures were very beneficial though and enjoyed watching them. If they offer this class in the same format again (which I doubt they will), be sure to check Piazza often as there are some pretty funny exchanges between rude students who take themselves a bit too seriously and TAs that are stretched a bit too thin.",

Also on the negative side, the quizes were poorly written, not particularly challenging and often contained errors.

The python programming itself was not difficult, but you did have to spend time understanding the concepts and the other code with which you were interfacing. Even though I felt like I knew the answers on the quizes, the quizes took extra time because of the ambiquity of the wording on some of the questions.

Unfortunately, we spent more time debating the quiz & assignmenting file-naming conventions than actually discussing the content of the course. e. g. One assignment we were required to name a file 'quiz4', another assignemnt we have to name a file 'quiz-7' with a '-' character. Students obsessed over these details since the autograder scripts apparently cannot accept filenames with even the slightest variation (no wildcard characters??). All of the problems from this semester stem from a lack of leadership. There was no leadership from the TAs; not something entirely expected but it really hurt the course. The faculty of Georgia Tech provided no communication about this course's professor or his absence. There was no attempt to repair the course that clearly got off to a rough start. Although the content was somewhat interesting, we could never benefit from professorial interaction. I will not recommend this course to a fellow student until it is improved.",

The quizzes were written by someone with absolutely no grasp of technical writing, or the English language in general. Project requirements were subject to change, and these changes weren't regularly stickied or announced. The coding required was extremely simple since most of the code is already written, and the hardest part is reading documentation. I would not recommend this course under any circumstances.

The TAs are left holding the bag, and things have been very disorganized as a result. The programming assignments are almost laughably easy (I completed most in less than an hour), but the multiple-choice quizzes take a ridiculous amount of time. A lot of the questions are so incredibly vague or the answers just didn't make any sense - in some cases, there were no correct answers available, which was acknowledged by the TAs on the course forum. My general process for handling the quizzes was to watch the lectures, read any supplemental papers that were linked, read the Piazza forum, watch the office hours... and when all that failed, as it frequently did, Google for the answers. I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 10-question multiple choice quiz can take upwards of 6 or 7 hours to complete. The Piazza forum itself is another issue... it's very frequently difficult to get any sort of 'official' response from a TA to questions. Students are helping each other as much as possible, but it would be nice to get official confirmation for questions that relate to policy/procedures. This is my first semester in the program, and I would have been really disappointed and questioning the caliber of the program if I weren't taking CS6300 concurrently.",

Some of the quiz text appears to be plagiarized from other sources because the content is not covered in readings or lectures. I have printed the quiz out and kept it handy while watching lectures which basically makes it easy to ace most of the questions. The TAs are also sticklers for following the directions, but we had the same issue in CS6300... some people just don't follow directions.

There is no professor involved with the course at this point, so it is entirely run by a group of TAs who do their best to make everything work but don't have the resources, time, or authority to fix the aspects of the course that are broken. The course consists of lectures, which in general are interesting and easy to follow, short Python networking assignments, and quizzes. If all of these were integrated into the Udacity system as they were originally when the course was created, everything would be much easier to deal with. Instead, the current TAs are locked out of the Udacity backend and have to create their own autograding system and quiz questions from scratch. Autograding has been a mess, with students receiving zero scores for seemingly correct work with no explanation, such as programming assigningments where the code is completely correct or quiz submissions where there is an extra newline at the end of the file. The TAs are spending a lot of time regrading and fixing these grading errors, but it's a huge distraction from the actual coursework. The quiz questions themselves are the weakest and newest part of the course, many of the questions are incorrect and are changed before the deadline, worded ambiguously due to grammar or other issues, cover material outside of the course itself, or use terminology and techniques simlar to but different from the course material. All these issues mean that there is a large backlog of questions from students on Piazza, and the TAs have a hard time keeping up. To succeed in this course procrastination is basically mandatory, because critical clarifications and changes to the quizzes and assignments will often only be posted a few days before the deadline. Aside all of these issues, the material in the course itself is very approachable and the workload is very reasonable in terms of time. I wish the higher level staff would do something to address the problems faced by both students and TAs in this course, because otherwise I would recommend this course a good way to get started in the OMSCS program without getting overwhelmed by courses that involve more advanced skills and a larger time committment.",

I was disappointed however because I am interested in the subject, and I feel that this class really only gave a whirlwind thin covering of the material. While I did learn more than I knew starting the class, I wanted more out of it. The assignments were a bizarre combination of ridiculously easy connect the dots exercises with explicit step by step instructions paired with buggy software and buggy instructions. I prefer it when the challenges in an assignment are inherit in the material rather than due to mistakes by the course developers. Finally, unlike with my other courses, I felt like the professor and TAs were dialing this course in and not really excited to be teaching it as part an online program.',

The provided virtual machine was a pain to use and sometimes I spent a couple hours trying to fix problems--my advice is to read, then re-read, and follow the assignment instructions exactly as written. Probably the hardest part of the course was learning Python which I had no knowledge of beforehand. It is somewhat easy class that could be taken along with a more difficult class.",

But very popular among new students (myself included) because we don't know what to expect from gatech grad course so want to test the water with an easier class. The professor seems to be very aloof, and the course is entirely ran by teaching assisants who are not very attentive on the forum. Most of the help you get will be from fellow students, given the size of the class, I'd say you'll bound to find help from good students. The assignments are horribly designed and not well tested before deployment. The quiz questions are ambigous, causing a lot of frustration. The quiz are not difficult at all, Most of the admitted students are smart and will be able to comprehend the material in the video lecture easily. So imagine how they can design the multiple choice questions to test your IQ? They make them very ambiguous so you might just choose the wrong answer even you understand everything they taught just fine. in Fall 2014 80% of the student got an A. No mid term no finals, just 10 easy programming assignments + multiple choice questions. Just brush up on your python programming (you need to be able to read code from framework, you only need to write a few lines for each assignment). A great deal of the frustration you'll get is to understand the python mininet API framework, which is the center piece of every assignment but none of the lecture video cover the framework at all. Use a good editor like pycharm so you can jump to definition of the framework python code. That's all you need.",

It also gave a whole bunch of extra progamming assignments and exposure to some newer technologies that improve upon Pyretic or expand its capabilities. Overall, the course is far too easy on its own, but the material itself is very interesting and if you dig a little deeper and do some extra work on your own, you can still get just as much out of it as you get out of the more stand-alone challenging courses. Do the mininet and OpenFlow and Pyretic tutorials on each project's website and understand what these technologies are doing, ahead of when it comes up in the course.",

    body: "I'm writing this shortly after the mid term. So far the class has been easy and the material has been underwhelming. \n\nThe lectures for part one are very slow with lots of repitition. Definitely speed them up to 1. 5-2x as you watch. The text book is good but rather dry. Much of the first half of the course is just a formalization of things most of us already know. \n\nIt is still early but I am definitely liking the material in the 2nd half of the course better than the 1st. The lectures are faster and we are covering material with greater depth. \n\nThe projects are very nice. They are a bit challenging, require a good understanding of the concepts involved, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time (~10-30 hours each). \n\nThe quizes and mid-term are basically regurgitations pulled verbatim out of the text at random. Quiz grades better reflect your ability to use the search function on the textbook PDF rather than an understanding of the concepts. The closed book mid-term had a median grade of 77. It is difficult not because of the material, but because the grader is looking for matches to random statements from the text book. TA's revise grades heavily and I'm confident the overall course will be graded on a curve but if you experience grade anxiety, this course may give you heartburn.",

The book material is a struggle to read through, the lectures are a bit more interesting, and the first half of the course gives you a lot of material to study for the midterm. The projects are great, but the first one can be frustrating if you're unfamiliar with C and assembly. The second project was cool - we used Cuckoo to analyze the behaviors of cryptolocker malware, keyloggers, and other trojans. \n\nThe midterm itself was kind of a let-down.

You need lots of time to read and go through the material. There is no brain-cracking stuff here. Its actually very simple. I enjoyed the content because it was really very interesting and worth knowing. I did enjoy the course, but as a first cohort student into this class, there were start-off glitches.

    body: "This class is both interesting and fun. The lectures aren't too long. So it is fairly easy to keep up. \n\nNot to be confused with High-Performance Computer Architecture.. this class is all about Parallel Algorithms and how to program Super-Computers. You learn the Work/Span model and how to evaluate algorithms for Parallel Computers. You develop Parallel programs and you learn how to use new primitives to solve problems in a parallel manner. You learn how to program with both the Shared Memory and Distributed Memory architectures. There also seems to be a part about Cache Oblivious algorithms at the end (though we haven't gotten to that yet). \n\nOn the negative side though, there are topics that should be covered in lectures but aren't so you'll have to learn them on your own from arcane papers. The course organization could be improved a bit so that we aren't jumping from topic to topic. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with the subject matter then it will take some iterations to understand it. I went through the lectures 3x. \n\nThe labs require a LOT of time. Best start them early. The code is in C and C++ with OpenMP and OpenMPI. The main issue is just getting the code to work in the first place so you can then plan with the parallel part. \n\nThe TAs seem inexperienced and are mostly absent unfortunately. The professor is very engaged and answers a lot of questions on Piazza. The lectures are fun and funny to watch. \n\nIts highly doubtful I'll get an A in this class and a B will only be possible if I improve (I've gotten an A in every other class I've taken in the program).",

    body: "I dropped this class but figured people considering it could use all the reviews they can get right now. \n\nThere's a disconnect between the lectures and labs in that the lectures are pretty short, not too dense, very entertaining, but don't cover what you need to know for the labs. There is a lot of studying of outside sources, not just the recommended readings, but whatever you can find on the algorithms you need to implement. They're not at all easy and you get very little credit for implementing them correctly. You'll spend a great deal of time just getting correct code, but you're graded mostly on performance, so keep that in mind. You need to pass the Udacity grader early, so you have plenty of time left to optimize and test your performance on the cluster. \n\nYou absolutely need to already know C, C++, and ideally at least a little about how OpenMP and OpenMPI work, or it's just going to get worse trying to learn that as you go. Know how to use common debugging and program analysis tools as well, gdb, valgrind, etc. You'll spend most of your time debugging early on when you're just trying to make sure the code works. \n\nFinally, know that it's not at all impossible to do well. I had trouble and had to drop because I was taking two other classes at the same time (including ML, which has very in-depth assignments) and was going through personal difficulties and just didn't have the time for it. If I had the time, I'm sure I'd have done fine. Just don't take the class lightly. You need to get an early start on every lab, do all the readings plus whatever other readings you can find, and get your code working early. I wish I'd known ahead of time we'd get almost nothing for correctness and be graded mostly on performance, which I guess makes sense in retrospect, but just wasn't what I was expecting based on all the other courses I've taken.",

I enjoyed the coding sessions and I think that the changes we were required to make are close to what you might see in the real world if you were modifying internal simulation software. The most difficult aspect is that there is little guidance as to whether or not the metrics that you find in your projects are the optimal solution. This simulates the real world, where you have to make sure that what you code isn't outputting crap numbers, but makes it difficult to ensure that you get a good grade on every assignment, especially those where you are competing against the other students.

Would have spent more time on the course if it was presented and maintained better. This course uses ProctorU and is mainly test based (60% of course grade - two midterms and a final). I had a horrible experience during the first midterm exam with ProctorU and it took almost 5 days to hear anything from the course staff.

For example our group worked very well, but many others complained in the forums about issues they were having where some team members were dead weight. Because of this your experience can vary greatly. You definetly need to know some Java going into this class. My knowledge was limmited to one class I took several years back, but was able to catch up quick by taking other online tutorials and READING BOOKs as I went and I Googled ALOT! The last project (originally scheduled to be a group project but changed after complaints about groups) was a solo project and very large. My project ended up being over 500 lines of code. It was a good challenging project and I am a better Java programmer for it. Also learning Android development for the first time was fun!',

Poor responsiveness on Piazza, with a week or more going by without any instructor or TA presence. Absurd grading... one assignment had us submit (among other things) a 'Hello World' program with a modification to include our name. I forgot to submit that one (partly because the way the assignments are written makes it tricky to pull out what's needed for a submission) and got docked 30% of the whole grade. The course makes use of the SESC simulator, which is one of the worst, most poorly documented codebases I've ever seen. In addition, the effort required to work with SESC and modify it was vastly out of proportion to what we were studying. I never understood how wading through SESC to figure out how to change the branch predictor had any relevance to what a real processor does. Finally, the exams were a disaster. They used ProctorTrack for the test, but it was basically open book in that you could use any printed or written references, but couldn't use anything on your computer. You had to do everything by hand on paper (like when doing the incredibly tedious cycle counting problems). This was a real problem in the test, because I hadn't done them that way... I always worked in OneNote to set up my tables, plug in my steps, etc. When I had to do it on paper on my desk, it was a complete mess.",

    body: 'In terms of content, the course gives a good introduction to the topics without assuming any previous experience but still getting into a lot of the technical and logistical issues of US health IT systems. In this semester, there were no exams and in their place were a set of timed quizzes. The quizzes are open notes/lectures and follow the lecture content very closely, so for the most part the questions can be answered if the student watches and understands the lecture material. Most of the more challenging work in the course has to do with the semester-long group project, which involves creating a web application that uses heatlh data records. The very start of the semester and project was somewhat disorganized, because many changes were made at the last minute to switch from the previous version of the group project to a new group project involving FHIR web services. Originally the course material stated that groups could use any web platform/framework/programming language, then after many groups formed around experience with particular technologies it was announced that all groups needed to use Java/Tomcat in order to deploy to particular machines at Georgia Tech that have access to the proprietary health data. The final deployment machines and data are not accessible to students during development, and at the end of the semester students will submit their completed WAR app which will be run on the machines with the full data for the first time without giving students the opportunity to fix any bugs or issues related to deployment and using the new data. Other than those issues (which my group avoided by requesting and being granted approval to use our own servers and data) the project is a straight-forward web application group project. Groups are required to use the health data in some way but aside from that the project is very open-ended in terms of what students can focus on for their app. As with any OMSCS group project, the previous experience of students varies greatly within the class, with some students having almost no web development experience on one end of the spectrum and some having worked in the industry for 10+ years on the other end. The groups are self-selected rather than assigned by the instructors so the overall experience level of the groups can vary as well. The instructors are active on Piazza with regular announcement posts and answers to questions from students, although sometimes basic details of assignments such as length or format of presentations are announced close to the deadline. For students with no web development or Java experience at all, I would suggest learning some basic skills before taking this course, and the CS 6300 course in the OMSCS program is the closest in terms of an intro to those sorts of development skills. Otherwise any student should be able to succeed in this course and I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the topics.',

A lot of groups had problems and partially due to that the last group project was changed to a solo project at the last minute.

I think the class could have had much more material and be more rigorous. Since I have quite a bit of industry experience I don't think I got a whole lot of new knowledge. The assignments were simple the only problem being coordinating with your team. In the end some of the projects (like Project3) just seemed like busy work. I think it is a good class to get you warmed up for the harder classes in the program. The Piazza forum had some interesting discussions going because of the variety of student background in the subject matter. The professor is very responsive in the forums and fun to watch in the lectures.",

If you already have this kind of background, the class should be a breeze. If not, there will be some catch-up, but it's not such a big deal. The one hickup to this class is that your experience will depend heavily on what group you were placed into, as the second group project was somewhat complicated if you don't have prior Android and SQL experience.

I already had some years of experience in software development and I still gained a good amount of knowledge. This class will give you the foundation so you can go deeper into software development processes so don't expect to be able to run a team of develpers, planners, testers, etc. just by taking this class. I say this because some people complained about the content of the class. If you don't have prior experience with software development and Java programming, you may need to spend a lot more time. Also, there was an Android project which I think it wasn't too bad but some people complianed about the need to learn a lot of things in a short period of time. The workload will increase towards the middle of the class since you may have individual assingments due while you are still working on a group project. Overall, I think this was a very enjoyable course.",

We spent a lot of time together, which was the hardest part, but we worked well together and I learned a lot about group work. Some weeks I spent very little time in this class. The start is slow and was a little boring, but when the group projects started I spent quite a bit more time talking to my group. We likely didn't have to, but we did.

My one serious concern is that, though the team projects did take some significant time and effort, the individual assignments were relatively simple (but also fun and good learning tools).

There are individual programming assignments as well however these are considerably easier than the group projects.

I will try and avoid classes with group projects from now on. In terms of grading, even when I thought my submission sucked, I got a decent grade. Even not knowing enough java, I would have gotten a B on my own but my awesome group assignments pushed me to an A. I hope in the future they reconsider that Android app project as it is just way too much in that short time (maybe extra crappy due to summer?)",

Some of the best lectures were the ones that were more interview/interactive in nature. The team focused nature of every project AND every assignment means you'll spend a lot of time coordinating with other people. The projects (45% of the grade) were physics-focused and we had to spend a lot of time dealing with those aspects of the project, which distracted from time to focus on the software architecture. The final exam covers the entire course, so do yourself a favor and prepare study questions as you go so you don't have to re-review and cram the week before finals! Overall, you'll definitely learn a lot in the class, but some of this stuff has to soak in over time and experience. I think with some tweaks this course could be really great; there were definitely some frustrations (and that's perhaps the price we pay for being the first group to take it online) but I think they are serious about trying to solve those for the next offering.",

This is not a physics course, however much of the development time on the projects will be devoted to figuring out how to model heat diffusion. The instructor should provide code or a jar file that can be used to perform these arbitrary calcualtions so that the students can focus on the real goals of the projects which should be learning how to architect and design a system. The instructor expects perfect papers, yet his course material is riddled with errors. There is even a dedicated place on the class forums to report these 'bugs. ' The only positive aspect of this is that it counts for class participation. I found many of the problems I reported just by copying the instructions and doing a spell check in Word. I know of 2 students who dropped other courses and one who withdrew from school because of this class. If you take it, be ready for a roller coaster ride. I never realized how much stress and anxiety can produce physical symptoms until I went to the doctor and she said I was likely experiencing a rapid heart beat and night sweats because of this class. The best thing about the whole experience is that now I have a profound respect for those people who deal with panic attacks on a daily basis. Worst class I've ever taken. Constantly made me consider dropping out of school. I almost think he made it this hard on purpose so it can be a 'weeder' class. I can just imagine him leaning back in his office chair and grinning as the negative feedback surveys come rolling in. Despite all of this, if you have to take it, try not to stress too much becasue I think (hope) most students will end up with an A or B regardless of the actual grades. See his 'grading philosophy' at https://www. udacity. com/wiki/saad/faq. One other positive...

First, there should be fewer assignments, they should be shorter, and they should be individual. I say this because I know a limiting factor is the workload on the graders, so some combination of fewer/shorter assignments can result in them grading the same number of pages as they do with the current set-up. Second, the projects need to be set up in a way that recognizes teams do not meet in person, and that teams are comprised of a wider variety of CS backgrounds than one would find on the on-campus program. People without programming experience can't contribute to the code, nor can they contribute much to documents that require understanding of the code. Third, the administration of the final exam has been a disaster. More than a few lucky students have been allowed up to three hours to take the test by their proctors, while others given only 60 minutes. To do well in the course, you must have some lucky combination of getting assigned to the right project teams, getting assigned to a lax grader, and getting a proctor who gives you far more than the allotted time for the final exam.",

Thankfully, on each team I was on there was always a physics guy, which was invaluable. The assignments can easily be done on your own, but I believe the group requirement for the assignments was to make things easier on the markers. Coordinating a group on the assignments was trivial; however coordinating the group for the projects was decidedly more difficult. I had two great teams, and one bad team, but I wouldn't use that as a reason to get rid of the group work. I found the group work a great way to meet other people in the OMSCS program. The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome.

Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments. \nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them. \nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting. \nWith some modifications, this can be a great course.",

It was probably one of the worst designed tests I've taken in terms of judging a student's grasp of the material. It's also hard to predict how well you will do, given that 50% of your grade is unknown until the final week of the course (a semester-long group project with VERY loose specifications).

There was also no real motivation to read all the suggested extra material. We were never tested on any of it. \n\n2) TEXT BOOK : I purchased the 'text BOOK ', which the professor DOES say is optional. It was VERY overpriced ($79. 95, even though the professor mistakenly says that students will be able to get the discounted price of $64. 95, which is STILL overpriced). For the price, it’s closer to the size of a PAMPHLET than a text BOOK !! I was very shocked when it came in the mail!\n\nDespite being overpriced, the lectures ARE based on the book content, so the book does indeed provide a solid foundation to the videos. It helped me a LITTLE with the midterm, but after the unfair/ambiguous/subjective questions on the midterm I probably would have done fine without the BOOK. \n\nDespite these kinks, I will say that Prof. Mark and TA Shan are very knowledgeable and responsive to concerns.",

They are also shorter and less numerous than the other courses I've taken. They include lots of interviews with industry people which is somewhat refreshing. Although the prof. often writes somewhat strange/debatable mutliple choice questions, the quizzes are generally easy if you watched the corresponding lectures recently. The project was open-ended (and initially somewhat undefined) and we were tasked with forming our own teams. The projects are either web or mobile apps so it's important that some of your team members have those skills. Upfront work identifying a good team and project will result in a smooth semester.",

    body: "The class lectures are informative and are generally an overview of the various topics presented throughout the course. No lectures really go all that in-depth on a particular subject though so it's more of a generalized view of informatics in the healthcare industry. There was a quiz every two weeks up until about 2/3 of the way through the course. At that point you're expected to work on the group project. The quizes questions for the most part were not very difficult if you paid attention to the lectures and used common sense; however, some of the questions were ambiguous at best and others downright confusing. \n\nWhat I found to be the most disappointing was the group project. Spring 2015 was the first semester they tried to use the GT FHIR server and it did not go well. Between the server constantly being under development, server connectivity problems, VPN problems, and a whole lot of other issues the project was a real pain for many groups. Our group decided fairly early on to abandon the GT FHIR server in favor of the more stable, public SPARK FHIR server and that turned out to be a good idea looking back on all the issues other groups were having. I felt our issues that we had to work through with our chosen server were relatively minor in comparison. \n\nGroup selection was an annoying issue with the course too. It look a couple weeks for everyone to find a group to join. The group I formed had a couple people express interest in joining only to find out they were apparently 'shopping' for the best group. The TAs sent out multiple requests trying to find groups for people to join as well. Also we didn't get to peer review our group members which was disappointing. The reason I say this class is Somewhat Easy is because the issues with the group project made it harder than it should have been.",

The class could be run a bit better, but it is not all bad. I see lots of interaction on Piazza between the students and the TA's. Also, the professor does pop in the forum from time to time. I think the problems this class is experiencing stem from the fact that the prof is trying to keep the class up to date, so there is some churn in the material. Not a bad class at all. Assignments are spread out over the semester, so some weeks there is nothing to do (well, we are supposed to be working on our project). When there is an assigment, reading or otherwise takes a few hours in addition to the quizzes. This semester, we had one (1) try at taking each quiz. You do have to think/know the material to get it right. Oh, and be careful if you know healthcare already, because your definitions might not match those presented in the class and using your definitions on the quizzes will be counted wrong (this happened to several people).

There are a number of quicky videos and a growing library to help you decide if you don't come in already with some ideas. The course has a number of short essays due weekly that step you through the process of identifying an area of interest, reviewing existing research, and scoping a research project or development tool project for the remainder of the semester. The project is formalized with a Proposal that includes weekly milestones and some progress deliverables prior to the final completed project. Along the way, your progress is monitored by a single 'mentor' (TA) that is there to answer questions and ensure that your are on track, scoped correctly, etc. An important component of the class is participation, which includes giving and getting peer feedback along the way with each of the essays. The students are encouraged to participate in daily discussions on Piazza which follow a weekly pattern... 'What did you learn?', 'Q&A with ??', 'Let's discuss +/- of an existing OMS course', etc. The instructor is Dr. David Joyner, of KBAI fame, and he is extremely active on Piazza, keeping the class lively and engaged, which is no mean feat since we are all doing different projects. The final coursework is not done, so I can't comment here how it will all end, but so far it is a joy to be part of this particular environment. It is different from other courses. There are still deliverables and the process is part of the course, but the project or research area is open-ended and up to the student to design.",

The Piazza engagement from all instructors and the studnets has been very positive and helpful. The material is not tremendously challenging, and that comes from someone who struggles at times with linear algebra - this course focuses more on application of concepts rather than the mechanics behind the concepts themselves. The course started with an example that bordered on a magic trick, which definitely set the stage for it to be an engaging semester. The workload is moderate and consistent. There is ample room to go above and beyond on the projects if you have extra time, but you can usually squeak by on them without losing too much sleep. As this was the first semester, there were a few (expected) hiccups, but they were for the most part minor.

    body: "My first OMS class, only 4 weeks to go. I have enjoyed it the whole way, learned a lot. Essa's lectures are good, I take notes on them as I watch. Comes in handy on the assignments so I can go right back to the exact section where he talked about something. Since they want you to use your own pics, it invests me with more interest in the assignments. I think the assignments have been very clear, and really not that hard conceptually. Paying attention to what is asked and answered on piazza helps. This is the first time I ever coded in python, that cost me hours of learning the syntax. OpenCV has reasonable documentation, but it might not all apply to your version. So fun at 2am. It's really opened my eyes to what is possible with computers. we are writing our own code, or using open source, and it has generally had impressive results. Class piazza tips and help has been invaluable, and people have seemed to hit the right balance between enough help to move on, but not give away too much. reading the suggested papers has provided the answers to how to progress more than once. This has been a great intro to the program, fun to be challenged again.",

    body: "I wish this course was a little more difficult. I haven't had to watch the lectures at all the entire semester and I have a 100 in the course... AND this is the first time I've ever used Python. A little disheartened that this course isn't challenging and I am starting to realize that I probably should have taken Computer Vision instead is I wanted more difficult programming exercises. Also very slow to get grades back. It's April and we haven't gotten grades back for assignments we completed in February.",
